There's a routine scale and polish, and then there's a deep cleaning. They share a name in casual conversation ("I'm going for a cleaning"), but they're genuinely different procedures that address different problems at different depths. Understanding which one you actually need determines what the appointment looks like, how long it takes, and what it costs.

The short version: a regular scale and polish costs £50-£120 and takes 30-45 minutes. A deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) for [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) costs £200-£400 per quadrant of the mouth and takes 45-90 minutes per quadrant, with multiple sessions. They're different levels of intervention for different levels of problem, and the distinction matters.

## The Regular Scale and Polish

This is the cleaning most people think of when they book a hygiene appointment. It's preventive maintenance: removing the build-up that accumulates between check-ups and keeping the gums healthy.

**Tartar removal** (scaling) is the first part. Tartar (calculus) is hardened dental plaque: a mineralised deposit that forms on tooth surfaces, particularly along the gum line and between teeth. Once plaque hardens into tartar, it can't be removed by brushing. It requires professional instruments.

The hygienist uses an ultrasonic scaler (a vibrating instrument that breaks tartar apart with sound waves and a water spray) and hand instruments (sharp, curved tools called scalers and curettes) to remove deposits from the visible tooth surfaces and just below the gum line. The ultrasonic scaler does the bulk of the work; the hand instruments refine the result.

**Polishing** follows. A rotating rubber cup loaded with a mildly abrasive paste smooths the tooth surfaces, removing surface stains (from coffee, tea, wine, tobacco) and leaving a clean, smooth feel. Some practices use an air polisher: a device that sprays a fine powder (glycine or sodium bicarbonate) mixed with water and air, which is particularly effective at removing stain from difficult-to-reach areas.

The whole process takes 30-45 minutes. It's mildly uncomfortable in areas where the gums are inflamed (the ultrasonic scaler can feel sensitive against irritated gum tissue), but it's not painful. Most patients describe it as "a bit scratchy" and appreciate the clean feeling afterward.

Cost: £50-£120 at most private practices. Recommended frequency: every 6-12 months, depending on how quickly tartar accumulates and the health of the gums.

## When Regular Cleaning Isn't Enough

The hygienist measures the gum pockets at each appointment. A small probe (basically a thin ruler) slides gently between the gum and the tooth, measuring the depth of the sulcus (the groove between gum and tooth).

Healthy gums have pocket depths of 1-3mm. The probe slides in a few millimetres, the gum is tight against the tooth, and there's no bleeding. Everything is functioning as designed.

Pockets of 4-5mm indicate gingivitis or early periodontitis. The gum tissue has started to detach from the tooth, creating a deeper groove where bacteria accumulate below the gum line. Bleeding on probing is common. At this stage, a regular scale and polish may not reach the bacteria and tartar deposits that are forming in these deeper pockets.

Pockets of 6mm or deeper indicate established [periodontitis](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices). The bone supporting the tooth has started to deteriorate. Bacteria are thriving in deep pockets that are inaccessible to a toothbrush, floss, or routine scaling. The situation needs more than a surface cleaning.

This is where deep cleaning enters the picture.

## Deep Cleaning: Scaling and Root Planing

Scaling and root planing (SRP) is a non-surgical periodontal treatment that goes deeper than a routine cleaning. The goal is to remove tartar, plaque, and bacterial toxins from the root surfaces of teeth, below the gum line, in pockets that range from 4mm to 8mm or deeper.

**Scaling** in this context means removing tartar from the root surfaces beneath the gum. These deposits aren't visible: they sit on the tooth root inside the pocket, covered by gum tissue. The hygienist or dentist works by feel, using fine curettes that reach into the pocket and scrape the root surface clean.

**Root planing** is the second part. After the tartar is removed, the root surface is smoothed (planed). Root surfaces that have been exposed to periodontal disease are rough and contaminated with bacterial endotoxins (toxins embedded in the root surface itself). Planing smooths the root, removes the contaminated outer layer, and creates a clean surface for the gum tissue to reattach to.

The procedure is performed under local anaesthetic because working beneath the gum on root surfaces is sensitive. The mouth is typically treated in quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left), with one or two quadrants treated per appointment. A full mouth deep cleaning requires 2-4 appointments spaced 1-2 weeks apart.

Each appointment takes 45-90 minutes per quadrant, depending on the severity of the deposits and the pocket depths. More advanced disease with deeper pockets and heavier calculus takes longer.

## The Cost Breakdown

| Treatment | What It Addresses | Cost | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scale and polish | Surface tartar, staining | £50-£120 | 30-45 mins |
| Deep cleaning per quadrant | Subgingival tartar, root planing | £200-£400 | 45-90 mins |
| Full mouth deep cleaning | All four quadrants | £800-£1,600 | 3-6 hours total |
| Periodontal maintenance | Follow-up after deep cleaning | £80-£150 | 45-60 mins |

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the initial assessment determines which level of cleaning is needed. The dental check-up includes periodontal probing and X-rays that reveal the extent of bone loss, if any.

## What Deep Cleaning Achieves

The results of scaling and root planing are measured in millimetres, and those millimetres matter.

After treatment, the inflammatory response in the gums subsides. The tissue shrinks slightly as the swelling resolves, and the gum tightens against the cleaned root surface. Pocket depths reduce by 1-3mm on average: a pocket that measured 6mm before treatment might measure 3-4mm after healing.

Bleeding on probing, the clinical sign of active inflammation, reduces dramatically. Gums that bled at every probing before treatment typically show minimal or no bleeding at reassessment.

The gum tissue itself changes visually. Inflamed gums are red, swollen, and glossy. Healthy gums are pink, firm, and stippled (with a slight orange-peel texture). The transition happens over 4-6 weeks after deep cleaning, and it's visibly remarkable.

These improvements aren't just cosmetic. Reduced pocket depth means less space for bacteria to colonise. Less bacterial colonisation means less ongoing bone destruction. Deep cleaning doesn't reverse the bone loss that's already occurred, but it halts the progression and gives the remaining bone structure a chance to stabilise.

## The Recovery

Deep cleaning recovery is milder than most people expect.

The gums are tender for 2-3 days after each session. The anaesthetic wears off in 2-4 hours, and the remaining discomfort is a generalised soreness rather than a sharp pain. Ibuprofen handles it comfortably.

Sensitivity to cold is common for 1-2 weeks after treatment. The cleaned root surfaces are more exposed to the oral environment as the gum tissue heals and tightens. This sensitivity resolves as the gums reattach and the root surfaces remineralise.

Some patients notice their teeth feel slightly longer after deep cleaning. This isn't the teeth growing; it's the gums shrinking. As the swelling resolves and the gum tissue tightens, the margin sits slightly lower than it did when the gums were swollen. This is the gums returning to a healthier position, even though it looks like [recession](/blog/receding-gums-treatment-cost-uk). The alternative, leaving the inflamed tissue untreated, results in continued bone and gum loss that produces far more recession over time.

Eating is unrestricted, though most people prefer softer foods for the first day or two after each session. A saltwater rinse after eating helps keep the treated areas clean during the healing period.

## After Deep Cleaning: The Maintenance Phase

Deep cleaning is the beginning of ongoing periodontal management, not a one-time fix. Gum disease is a chronic condition: it can be controlled but not cured. The bacteria that caused the disease are permanent residents of the mouth; the goal is to keep their numbers low enough that the gums and bone remain stable.

Periodontal maintenance appointments, scheduled every 3-4 months (more frequently than the 6-12 monthly intervals for people without gum disease), maintain the results of deep cleaning. Each maintenance appointment includes:

Full pocket depth measurement to monitor stability. Scaling and root planing of any pockets that have deepened. Polish to remove surface deposits. Assessment of home care effectiveness and targeted guidance.

These appointments cost £80-£150 each. Four per year: £320-£600 annually. The cost of maintaining periodontal health is significant but substantially less than the cost of tooth loss and replacement: a single [dental implant costs £1,999](/pricing) at UrgentCare Dental.

## Who Needs Deep Cleaning

The need for deep cleaning is determined by clinical findings, not symptoms. Many people with moderate periodontal disease have no pain, no obvious bleeding, and no awareness that anything is wrong. The disease is painless in its early and moderate stages, which is precisely why it progresses to the point of needing deep cleaning without the person realising.

The clinical indicators that prompt a deep cleaning recommendation:

Pocket depths of 4mm+ in multiple sites. Bleeding on probing (inflamed pockets bleed when the probe enters). Tartar visible on X-rays below the gum line. Bone loss visible on X-rays around the tooth roots. A history of gum disease or periodontal treatment.

Risk factors that make deep cleaning more likely: smoking (the single biggest risk factor for periodontitis), diabetes, genetic predisposition, infrequent dental visits, and certain medications that cause gum overgrowth.

## The Long View

Untreated gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Not decay. Not trauma. Gum disease. The slow, painless destruction of the bone that holds teeth in the jaw, progressing over years until the teeth become mobile and eventually unsaveable.

Deep cleaning intervenes in that trajectory. It stops the bacterial assault on the bone, allows the gums to heal, and stabilises the support structure that keeps the teeth in place. The investment, £800-£1,600 for the initial treatment plus £320-£600 per year in maintenance, is the cost of keeping natural teeth that might otherwise be lost.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the periodontal assessment is part of every [dental check-up](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk). If deep cleaning is needed, the treatment plan covers the number of sessions, the cost per quadrant, and the maintenance schedule that follows. The conversation happens with the probing chart and X-rays on screen: concrete evidence of what's happening, and a clear plan for addressing it.

The difference between a scale and polish and a deep cleaning is the difference between maintenance and intervention. Knowing which one you need, and getting it at the right time, is the difference between keeping your teeth and losing them.
