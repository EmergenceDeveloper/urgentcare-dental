If you're not from West Yorkshire, you've probably never heard of the Heavy Woollen District.

But if you grew up in Batley, Dewsbury, Heckmondwike, Cleckheaton, Birstall, Liversedge or Gomersal, you know exactly what it means. It's that cluster of mill towns in the Spen Valley where everywhere blurs into everywhere else. You're never quite sure where one town ends and the next begins, and honestly, it doesn't really matter. It's all connected.

The name comes from the textile industry that built the area. Heavy woollen cloth, blankets, mungo and shoddy. The mills are mostly gone now, converted or demolished, but the bones of the place remain. The architecture. The valleys. The particular feeling of towns that grew up making things.

We're UrgentCare Dental, based in Leeds at Whitehall Estate in Armley. From most of the Heavy Woollen District, that's about fifteen to twenty minutes. Straight up the M62 and off at junction 3, or through Morley if you'd rather avoid the motorway.

We wanted to say hello.

## Who We Are

We're an emergency and urgent care dental practice at heart. When something goes wrong with your teeth and you need to be seen quickly, that's what we're here for. [Emergency appointments](/pricing) are £20, we're open seven days a week, and same-day appointments are usually available.

But we do everything else too. [Check-ups](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk), [fillings](/blog/white-filling-costs-uk), [crowns](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk), [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), [whitening](/pricing), [implants](/implants), [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk). The full range. Dr. Zain Chishty is our Clinical Director, and he's built a practice around the idea that good dental care shouldn't be complicated or confusing to access.

## An Invitation

The Heavy Woollen District has always been practical. Working towns, working people, not a lot of fuss. We like to think we operate the same way.

Our [prices](/pricing) are listed clearly on our website. When you come in, we'll explain your options honestly and let you decide what's right for you. No pressure, no judgement about how long it's been, no unnecessary complexity.

If you've been meaning to sort your teeth out, or if something's been bothering you and you're not sure where to go, we're just up the road.

Batley, Dewsbury, Heckmondwike, Cleckheaton, and all the places in between. You're welcome here.
