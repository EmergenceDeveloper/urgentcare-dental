There's a moment, usually somewhere between the dentist saying "that tooth needs to come out" and you nodding along like you understood, where a question floats up that you're almost embarrassed to ask.

*How much is this going to cost?*

It's not a small question. And the answer, frustratingly, is "it depends." But it depends in predictable ways, and once you understand those ways, the whole thing becomes a lot less mysterious.

Here's the short version: private tooth extractions in the UK run from about £75 for the simplest cases up to £600 or more for complex surgical work. Most people pay somewhere between £100 and £300.

Now let's get into why there's such a range, and where you're likely to fall within it.

## Simple Extractions: The Straightforward Ones

A simple extraction is exactly what it sounds like. The tooth is visible, it's not broken, it's not fused to the bone in any unusual way. Your dentist numbs the area, loosens the tooth with specialised instruments, and lifts it out. The whole thing takes maybe fifteen to twenty minutes.

For this kind of extraction, you're typically looking at £75 to £200 at a private practice. At [UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), simple extractions are £149.

Most extractions fall into this category. That molar your dentist has been watching for the past year, the one with the crack that finally gave up? Probably a simple extraction. The tooth that's been loose since that infection cleared up? Same thing.

The word "simple" doesn't mean painless or trivial, by the way. It just means straightforward from a technical standpoint. You'll still get proper anaesthesia, you'll still need recovery time, and it'll still feel like a significant thing happened in your mouth. But the procedure itself is routine.

## Complex Extractions: When Things Get Trickier

Sometimes a tooth doesn't want to come out easily. Maybe it's broken off at the gum line, leaving nothing to grip. Maybe the roots are curved in unusual directions, or the tooth has partially fused to the surrounding bone. Maybe there's significant decay that's weakened the whole structure.

These situations call for a complex extraction. Your dentist might need to section the tooth into pieces and remove it bit by bit, or carefully work around fragile root fragments, or deal with bone that's grown tight around the tooth over years of inflammation.

Complex extractions take longer, require more skill, and cost more. Expect to pay somewhere between £200 and £450 at most private practices. At UrgentCare Dental, [complex extractions are £399](/pricing).

The line between simple and complex isn't always obvious from the outside. A tooth that looks straightforward might turn out to have unusual root anatomy that only shows up on the X-ray. That's why practices quote a range, or sometimes quote after they've had a proper look at what they're dealing with.

## Surgical Extractions: The Involved Procedures

Surgical extractions go a step further. These involve cutting into the gum tissue, possibly removing some bone, and extracting a tooth that isn't accessible through normal means.

The classic example is an impacted wisdom tooth, buried sideways under the gum, pressing against the tooth next door. But surgical extractions happen with other teeth too. Sometimes a tooth breaks during extraction and the remaining root needs surgical removal. Sometimes a tooth never erupted properly and sits trapped beneath the surface.

Surgical extraction prices range from £300 to £600 or more, depending on complexity. At UrgentCare Dental, [surgical extractions are £549](/pricing).

These procedures take longer to perform and longer to heal from. Your dentist will typically place stitches that dissolve on their own over a week or two. Swelling and discomfort last several days rather than just one or two. It's a bigger deal, and the pricing reflects that.

## Wisdom Teeth: Their Own Category

Wisdom teeth get special mention because they're so common and so variable in what they cost to remove.

A wisdom tooth that's fully erupted and positioned normally? That might come out as a simple extraction for £100 to £200. A wisdom tooth that's impacted, angled sideways, with roots wrapped around your jaw nerve? That's a surgical extraction at the upper end of the price range, potentially £400 to £600 per tooth.

At UrgentCare Dental, [wisdom tooth removal is £549 per tooth](/pricing), which covers even the complex impacted cases.

Many people need multiple wisdom teeth removed. Some practices offer package pricing for doing all four at once, which can work out cheaper per tooth than doing them individually over separate appointments. Worth asking about if you're facing a full set of extractions.

## The Sedation Question

Here's something that changes the calculation significantly for a lot of people: sedation.

Standard extractions use local anaesthetic. Your mouth goes numb, you feel pressure and movement but no pain, and you're fully awake throughout. For most people, that's fine. Uncomfortable, maybe. Strange, certainly. But manageable.

For others, the idea of being awake while someone removes their tooth is genuinely terrifying. Dental anxiety is real, it's common, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. If you've been putting off a necessary extraction because you can't face the procedure, sedation might be what makes it possible.

IV sedation puts you into a deeply relaxed, drowsy state. You're technically conscious but you won't remember the procedure afterward, and you won't care what's happening while it's happening. It's the "twilight sleep" you might have heard about.

The catch is cost. IV sedation typically adds £200 to £400 on top of your extraction fee. At some practices, that means a simple extraction that would have been £150 suddenly becomes £450 or more.

At UrgentCare Dental, there's an [extraction with sedation bundle for £695](/pricing). That includes the IV sedation and the extraction together, which works out meaningfully cheaper than paying for each separately, especially compared to places charging £400 per hour for sedation alone.

If anxiety has been the thing stopping you from dealing with a tooth that needs to come out, that bundled option might be worth knowing about.

## What Affects Where You Fall in These Ranges

Beyond the type of extraction, a few other things influence what you'll actually pay.

**Location matters.** Practices in central London tend to charge more than practices in Leeds or Manchester, sometimes 20-30% more for the same procedure. Higher rents, higher prices. If you're in an expensive area, it might be worth looking at practices slightly further out.

**The specific tooth matters.** Front teeth with single roots come out more easily than back molars with multiple curved roots. A lower molar might be more complex than an upper one in the same position because of how the jaw bone differs between the two.

**Your individual anatomy matters.** Dense bone, unusual root shapes, previous dental work that's changed the structure around the tooth. These things vary person to person and affect how straightforward the extraction will be.

**Urgency sometimes matters.** Emergency appointments, especially outside normal hours, often carry a premium. If you can wait for a scheduled appointment rather than needing someone right now at 9pm on a Saturday, you'll usually pay less. Though of course sometimes you genuinely can't wait, and that's what [emergency dental services](/contact) exist for.

## What's Actually Included in the Price

When a practice quotes you for an extraction, that price usually covers the procedure itself plus local anaesthetic. But it's worth confirming what else is or isn't included.

**X-rays** are sometimes bundled in, sometimes charged separately at £20 to £50. You'll almost certainly need at least one X-ray before an extraction so your dentist can see what they're dealing with below the gum line.

**The consultation** might be included or might be a separate fee. Some practices charge £50 to £100 just for the initial examination and treatment planning. At UrgentCare Dental, [consultations for emergency and urgent care are £20](/pricing), which gets deducted from your treatment cost if you proceed.

**Follow-up appointments** are usually included if you need them, but worth confirming. Most straightforward extractions don't require a follow-up, but surgical cases often do.

**Prescriptions** for painkillers or antibiotics, if needed, are typically separate. Not everyone needs them, but they're common after surgical extractions.

## The NHS Question

You might be wondering about NHS pricing. Technically, tooth extractions fall under Band 2 treatment, which is around £75 in England. Wales is slightly cheaper, and Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own fee structures.

Those prices look appealing on paper. The reality is that getting NHS dental care in the UK right now is extremely difficult. Roughly 90% of dental practices aren't accepting new NHS patients.

This isn't a temporary blip. The NHS dental system has been in crisis for years, and there's no sign of it improving. For most people needing a tooth out, private care is the only realistic option, which is why understanding private pricing matters.

## Recovery: What to Expect

The extraction itself is one thing. What comes after is another.

Simple extractions typically involve a day or two of mild discomfort, manageable with over-the-counter painkillers. You might have some swelling. You'll want to eat soft foods and avoid the extraction site when chewing. Most people feel essentially normal within three to four days.

Surgical extractions take longer. A week of noticeable swelling isn't unusual. Discomfort lasts several days and might require stronger painkillers. The socket takes longer to heal. Most people are back to normal activities within a week or two, but full healing of the bone and gum tissue takes several months.

Wisdom tooth recovery varies enormously depending on how impacted they were. A simple wisdom tooth extraction might feel like any other extraction. A heavily impacted one can mean a week of significant swelling, difficulty opening your mouth fully, and careful eating.

None of this is to scare you. Millions of extractions happen every year without complications. But it's worth knowing what you're signing up for so you can plan accordingly. Maybe don't schedule that important presentation for the day after your surgical extraction.

## Making the Decision

If you've been told a tooth needs to come out, you've probably already weighed the options. Sometimes there are alternatives: root canal treatment to save an infected tooth, a crown to protect a cracked one. But sometimes extraction really is the right answer, either because other options won't work or because they'd cost significantly more for an uncertain outcome.

A tooth that's badly broken, severely decayed, or causing repeated infections often makes more sense to extract than to try saving. The extraction cost might seem significant in the moment, but it's usually less than the cost of attempting a root canal that might fail, followed by the extraction anyway.

Whatever you're facing, the first step is getting someone to actually look at the tooth and tell you what you're dealing with. At UrgentCare Dental, that [initial consultation is £20](/contact), and if you need the extraction, that amount comes off your treatment cost. You'll leave knowing exactly what needs to happen and exactly what it will cost, no surprises.

Sometimes just having the numbers makes the whole thing feel more manageable.
