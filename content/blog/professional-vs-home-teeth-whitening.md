The question isn't really whether to whiten your teeth. You've already decided that. The question is how: the £30 kit from the chemist, or the £500 appointment at the dentist? Because the price gap is wide enough to make anyone pause. Is professional whitening genuinely six times better, or is the home kit a quiet bargain that the dental industry would rather you didn't know about?

The answer sits between those two assumptions, and it's more nuanced than either side's marketing suggests.

## What's in the Box (And What's in the Chair)

The active ingredient in teeth whitening is hydrogen peroxide, or its precursor carbamide peroxide. Both release oxygen molecules that penetrate the enamel and break down the pigmented compounds (chromogens) trapped within the tooth structure. The chemistry is the same whether the peroxide comes from a chemist-shelf kit or a dental surgery.

The difference is concentration.

UK law limits the peroxide concentration available outside a dental surgery. Home whitening kits sold over the counter can contain up to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. Kits dispensed by a dentist for home use can contain up to 6% hydrogen peroxide. Professional in-surgery whitening uses concentrations up to 35% hydrogen peroxide, sometimes with an activating light.

That concentration gap translates directly into results. Higher concentration means more oxygen molecules penetrating deeper into the enamel in less time. A 35% in-surgery treatment achieves in one hour what a 0.1% over-the-counter kit might achieve over weeks of daily application, if it achieves it at all.

## The Professional Options

### In-Surgery Whitening

The treatment takes 60-90 minutes in the dental chair. The gums are protected with a barrier (a rubber dam or painted-on shield), and a high-concentration peroxide gel is applied to the teeth. Some systems use an activating light; others rely on the gel alone.

The gel is applied in 2-3 rounds of 15-20 minutes each, with fresh gel applied at each round. The dentist monitors the colour change throughout, comparing the teeth to a shade guide.

Results: 6-8 shades lighter in a single session. The change is visible immediately, and the final result settles over the following 48 hours as the teeth rehydrate (they dehydrate slightly during treatment, which temporarily makes them appear even whiter than the stable result).

Cost: [£549 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing) for in-office whitening. Across the UK: £400-£700.

### Take-Home Professional Kits

The dentist takes impressions of the teeth and creates custom-fitted whitening trays: thin, flexible plastic shells that fit precisely over the teeth. The patient fills these trays with professional-grade whitening gel (typically 10-16% carbamide peroxide, equivalent to 3-6% hydrogen peroxide) and wears them for 1-2 hours daily, or overnight, for 2-4 weeks.

Results: 4-8 shades lighter over the treatment period. The change is gradual, developing over days and weeks. The final result is comparable to in-surgery whitening, though it takes longer to achieve.

Cost: [£349 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing) for the take-home kit. Across the UK: £250-£500.

### Combination Approach

Some practices offer both: an in-surgery session for immediate results, followed by take-home trays for maintenance and fine-tuning. This delivers the instant gratification of the in-surgery treatment with the sustained results of the take-home approach.

## The Home Kit Options

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips

Thin, flexible strips coated with peroxide gel that stick to the teeth. Worn for 30-60 minutes daily for 1-2 weeks. The peroxide concentration is limited to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide under UK regulations.

Results: 1-3 shades lighter. The change is subtle. In some cases, barely perceptible. The strips don't conform perfectly to every tooth surface, which can produce uneven whitening: lighter in the middle of each tooth, darker at the edges and between teeth.

Cost: £20-£50 per box.

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpastes contain mild abrasives and low-concentration peroxides or other bleaching agents. They remove surface stains from coffee, tea, and wine but don't change the intrinsic colour of the tooth.

The distinction matters. Surface stains sit on top of the enamel. Intrinsic discolouration is embedded within the enamel structure. Whitening toothpaste addresses the former. Only peroxide-based whitening addresses the latter.

Results: removal of surface staining. No change in the underlying tooth colour. Teeth may appear slightly brighter, but the shade itself doesn't shift.

Cost: £5-£15 per tube.

### Online "Whitening Kits" from Unregulated Sources

Here's where the honest comparison includes a warning. Whitening products sold online, particularly from non-UK sources, sometimes contain peroxide concentrations that exceed UK legal limits. Some contain concentrations as high as 25-35% hydrogen peroxide, delivered without dental supervision, without gum protection, and without the custom trays that ensure even application.

These products can cause chemical burns to the gums, severe tooth sensitivity, and uneven, blotchy whitening. The damage to gum tissue from high-concentration peroxide applied without protection can be permanent.

The price (£50-£150) sits between over-the-counter kits and professional treatment, which makes them feel like a sensible middle ground. The risk profile makes them anything but.

## The Results Comparison

| Method | Shade Change | Duration | Safety | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-surgery professional | 6-8 shades | 1 hour | Supervised | £400-£700 |
| Take-home professional | 4-8 shades | 2-4 weeks | Dentist-guided | £250-£500 |
| OTC whitening strips | 1-3 shades | 1-2 weeks | Low-concentration | £20-£50 |
| Whitening toothpaste | Surface only | Ongoing | Minimal | £5-£15 |

The gap in results between professional and home whitening is significant. A 6-8 shade change is the difference between noticeably yellow teeth and a genuinely bright smile. A 1-3 shade change is often too subtle for anyone but the person in the mirror to notice.

## Sensitivity

Tooth sensitivity during and after whitening is the most common side effect, and its severity correlates directly with peroxide concentration.

Professional in-surgery whitening at 35% concentration produces temporary sensitivity in most patients. The teeth feel zingy, reactive to temperature, and occasionally produce spontaneous sharp twinges. This typically lasts 24-48 hours after treatment and resolves completely. The dentist manages this with desensitising agents applied immediately after treatment, and by adjusting the treatment intensity if sensitivity becomes uncomfortable during the session.

Professional take-home kits at 10-16% carbamide peroxide produce milder sensitivity that develops gradually over the treatment period. Wearing the trays for shorter periods or taking a day off between applications manages it effectively. The custom-fit trays also minimise gum contact, reducing gum irritation.

Over-the-counter strips at 0.1% hydrogen peroxide produce minimal sensitivity in most people. The concentration is low enough that the enamel isn't significantly challenged.

People with naturally [sensitive teeth](/blog/sensitive-teeth-treatments), exposed root surfaces, cracked enamel, or [receding gums](/blog/receding-gums-treatment-cost-uk) are more susceptible to whitening sensitivity regardless of the method used. A dental assessment before whitening identifies these risk factors and allows the treatment to be tailored accordingly.

## What Whitening Can and Can't Do

Whitening works on natural tooth structure. It lightens the intrinsic colour of enamel by breaking down the pigmented molecules embedded within it. For teeth that are uniformly discoloured from age, diet, or natural variation, whitening produces excellent, even results.

Whitening doesn't work on dental restorations. [Fillings](/blog/how-long-do-fillings-last), [crowns](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk), [veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk), and [bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) don't change colour with peroxide treatment. If you have visible restorations, particularly on front teeth, whitening the natural teeth can create a mismatch: the natural teeth lighten while the restorations stay their original shade. The restorations may need replacing to match the new tooth colour after whitening.

Some types of discolouration respond poorly to whitening. Tetracycline staining (dark horizontal bands caused by antibiotic use during tooth development) requires extended, intensive whitening over months, and results are partial. Fluorosis (white spots from excess fluoride during development) can actually become more visible after whitening, as the surrounding enamel lightens but the white spots remain unchanged.

Grey discolouration from a dead or [root canal treated](/blog/root-canal-front-tooth-uk) tooth doesn't respond to external whitening because the discolouration comes from inside the tooth. Internal bleaching (placing bleach inside the tooth) is the treatment for this specific problem.

## Which Is Better Value?

The answer depends on what outcome you're paying for.

If you want a noticeable, lasting transformation, professional whitening delivers more result per pound. The £349-£549 investment produces a change that's visible in photos, in conversation, and in the mirror. The take-home kit at £349 is particularly strong value: professional-grade results achieved at home, with custom trays that can be reused for touch-up whitening in the future (just purchase additional gel).

If you want to maintain the results of professional whitening, over-the-counter products play a support role. Whitening toothpaste preserves the result by removing surface stains that accumulate between treatments. Used in combination with professional whitening, they extend the intervals between touch-ups.

If you want the absolute cheapest option and accept modest results, over-the-counter strips provide a subtle improvement for £20-£50. The result won't be dramatic, but for someone with mild staining who wants a slight brightening, it may be sufficient.

## The Maintenance Question

Professional whitening results last 1-3 years before the teeth gradually return toward their original shade. The speed of this fade depends on dietary habits (coffee, tea, red wine, and berries are the main culprits), smoking status, and oral hygiene.

Touch-up treatments maintain the result. With professional take-home trays, a touch-up involves using the trays with fresh gel for 2-3 nights every 6-12 months. The cost is just the gel refill: £30-£50. This ongoing maintenance keeps the result stable indefinitely.

Over-the-counter products need more frequent application to maintain results: continuous or near-continuous use of whitening strips or toothpaste, at ongoing cost.

## The Starting Point

A dental assessment before any whitening is valuable, regardless of the method chosen. The dentist checks for:

Cavities that need filling before whitening (peroxide in an unfilled cavity causes severe sensitivity). Gum disease that needs treating first. Existing restorations that won't change colour. Intrinsic staining types that respond differently to whitening. Overall tooth health and enamel integrity.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the whitening consultation covers the assessment, shade-matching, and recommendation for the best approach. [In-office whitening is £549](/pricing). [Take-home professional whitening is £349](/pricing). Both include the full treatment and aftercare guidance.

The chemist-shelf kit and the dental chair treatment use the same chemistry. The difference is concentration, supervision, custom fit, and results. For some people, the modest brightening of an over-the-counter product is enough. For others, the transformation of professional whitening is what they're after. Knowing the difference means choosing the right tool for the result you want.
