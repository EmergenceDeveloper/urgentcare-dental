Here's something that might change how you think about this: professional teeth whitening can go six to eight shades lighter than your current colour. Sometimes even more.

That's not a small difference. That's the kind of difference where people genuinely notice. Where you catch yourself smiling more in photos. Where you stop doing that thing where you smile with your mouth closed because you're a bit self-conscious about it.

And the cost? Somewhere between £200 and £700 at most UK practices, depending on the type of treatment. That's the real range you're looking at.

But before we get into all that, there's something worth understanding first. Something that might actually make you feel better about the whole situation.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/), our take-home whitening kits start at £349, and in-office whitening runs £549. We'll get into exactly what those different options involve in a moment, but first, there's something important to understand about why the professional stuff actually works.

## Why Teeth Go Yellow in the First Place (It's Probably Not Your Fault)

Here's something most people don't realise: your teeth were always going to get yellower. It's just what happens.

The outer layer of your teeth, the enamel, is actually slightly translucent. Underneath it sits another layer called dentin, which is naturally more yellow. When you're young, your enamel is thick and bright and hides the dentin pretty well. But enamel wears down over time. Slowly, year by year, that yellower layer underneath starts showing through more.

This happens to everyone. It's not a sign you've done something wrong. It's just teeth doing what teeth do.

Now, yes, coffee and tea and red wine speed things up. So does smoking. These leave stains on the surface of your enamel, adding to the yellowing effect. But even if you'd spent your whole life drinking nothing but water, your teeth would still be darker now than they were when you were twenty. That's just biology.

The good news? Both kinds of yellowing respond really well to whitening. The surface stains from coffee and wine lift off beautifully. And the deeper discolouration from thinning enamel can be brightened too. Professional whitening works on both.

## Why Shop-Bought Whitening Never Quite Delivers

You've probably tried the strips. Or the toothpaste that promises "whiter teeth in two weeks." Or one of those LED light kits from Amazon that seemed promising at midnight but arrived looking a bit suspicious.

And maybe you saw... something? A slight difference? Hard to tell, really.

There's a reason for that, and it comes down to chemistry. Under UK law, over-the-counter whitening products can only contain 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. That's the active ingredient that actually bleaches the stains out of your enamel.

Dentists, on the other hand, can legally use up to 6% hydrogen peroxide. That's sixty times stronger.

This isn't some arbitrary regulation. The higher concentrations genuinely require professional supervision because they need to be applied correctly, with your gums protected, by someone who knows what they're doing. But the trade-off is results that actually show up in a meaningful way.

The shop-bought stuff isn't useless, exactly. It's just operating with one hand tied behind its back. A Which? investigation found that 21 out of 36 online whitening products actually exceeded the legal hydrogen peroxide limit, some by as much as 300 times. So you're either getting something too weak to work, or something illegally strong that could damage your teeth and gums without proper application. Neither option is ideal.

## What Different Treatments Actually Cost

Professional whitening comes in a few different forms, and understanding the differences helps explain the price variation.

Most people go for **take-home kits from their dentist**, which run £200 to £400 across the UK. Your dentist takes impressions, makes custom trays that fit precisely, and gives you professional-strength gel to use at home. You wear the trays for a couple of weeks, usually overnight or for a few hours during the day, and the colour gradually shifts. The results are the same as in-chair whitening; it just takes longer to get there.

If you'd rather walk out with the results already visible, that's **in-chair whitening**: sometimes called laser whitening or power whitening, and it runs between £400 and £700. You sit in the dental chair for about an hour while your dentist applies high-concentration gel, often activated by a special light. It's the instant gratification option, and some people really value that, especially if there's an event coming up.

Then there's the best-of-both-worlds approach. **Combination treatments** give you a session in the chair to kick things off, then custom trays for ongoing maintenance. These packages usually sit around £500 to £700.

There's also considerable variation based on where you are in the country. London practices tend to charge more simply because their overheads are higher. A practice in Leeds or Manchester might offer the same quality treatment for less.

## When Whitening Works Beautifully (And When It Might Not)

For most people, whitening works exactly as hoped. The stains from years of coffee and tea lift away, the general yellowing brightens up, and you're left with a smile that looks like a fresher, more awake version of yourself.

But there are some situations where things get more complicated.

If your discolouration comes from tetracycline antibiotics taken during childhood, or from fluorosis (too much fluoride during tooth development), you're dealing with what dentists call intrinsic staining. The discolouration is inside the tooth structure itself, not sitting on the surface. Whitening can still help, but the results might be less dramatic, and you might need more sessions to get where you want to be.

And here's one that catches people off guard: whitening only works on natural teeth. If you've got crowns, veneers, or tooth-coloured fillings on your front teeth, those won't change colour. They'll stay exactly as they are while your natural teeth brighten around them.

This doesn't mean you can't whiten if you've got dental work. It just means sequencing matters. Often the smart move is to whiten first, get your natural teeth to the shade you want, and then have any visible restorations updated to match. Your dentist can talk you through what makes sense for your specific situation.

The consultation exists precisely for this kind of thing. A good dentist will take one look and tell you honestly: "Yes, this will work brilliantly for you" or "Actually, here's what we'd need to think about first."

## How Long the Results Last

This is where professional whitening really earns its keep. With good care, in-chair treatments can last one to three years before you'd want a touch-up. Take-home kits from your dentist typically last six months to a year.

Compare that to over-the-counter products, which might give you a few months of subtle improvement at best, and you start to see the value equation differently.

Of course, "with good care" is doing some work in that sentence. If you're drinking coffee and red wine daily and smoking, your results won't last as long. But most people find that their professional whitening stays noticeably brighter than their starting point for a good long while.

The other thing worth knowing: once you've had the custom trays made, top-up treatments become much cheaper. At UrgentCare Dental, touch-up sessions run just £50. The trays last for years, so you're only paying for fresh gel when you want to brighten things up again.

## The Sensitivity Question

People worry about this, and that's fair. Whitening can cause temporary sensitivity in some people, a kind of zingy feeling when you drink something cold or breathe in cold air.

The key word there is temporary. For most people, any sensitivity fades within a day or two after treatment. And professional whitening actually tends to cause less sensitivity than using over-the-counter products for extended periods, because you're getting results faster rather than exposing your teeth to lower-grade bleaching agents week after week.

If you already have sensitive teeth, let your dentist know. There are desensitising treatments that can be applied before and after whitening, and they can adjust the concentration and timing to make things more comfortable.

## The Moment People Describe

There's this specific moment that comes up again and again when people talk about getting their teeth whitened.

It's usually a few days after the treatment, once any initial sensitivity has settled and they've stopped obsessively checking their teeth in every reflective surface. They're going about their normal day, maybe catching a glimpse of themselves in a shop window or a bathroom mirror, and something feels different.

It takes a second to place it. And then they realise: oh, I'm smiling. Just... smiling. Without thinking about it. Without checking first.

That's the thing about teeth. When you're self-conscious about them, you develop all these little habits without even noticing. The closed-lip smile in photos. The hand that comes up to cover your mouth when you laugh. The way you angle your face in video calls.

And then suddenly those habits don't feel necessary anymore. Not because anyone told you to stop, but because the thing you were protecting yourself from just... isn't there anymore.

That's what people are actually paying for. Not the chemistry, not the trays, not the appointments. They're paying to get out of their own way.

## One More Thing Worth Knowing

If you're thinking about [clear aligners](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) to straighten your teeth, our aligner packages include whitening for free. Same goes for some of our [smile makeover](/blog/smile-makeover-costs) packages. It's worth asking about, because straightening and whitening together is genuinely transformative, and getting the whitening bundled in makes the whole thing feel like better value.

Whitening works on natural teeth, by the way, not on crowns, [bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), or fillings. If you've got visible dental work, your dentist can help you figure out the best sequence: often whitening first, then matching any new restorations to your brighter shade.

The consultation to figure all this out? That's free at UrgentCare Dental. No obligation, just a proper look at your teeth and an honest conversation about what would actually make a difference.

You've probably been thinking about this for a while. Maybe years. Noticing your teeth in photos, wondering if it's worth it, telling yourself you'll look into it properly at some point.

This is that some point. And the version of you on the other side of it? They're going to wonder what took so long.
