Root canals have a reputation for being long, complicated, gruelling affairs. And for [molars](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), that reputation has some basis: multiple canals, complex anatomy, two-hour procedures, and costs that climb above £1,000.

Front teeth are a different story entirely.

A root canal on a front tooth (an incisor or canine) is the simplest, fastest, and most affordable root canal there is. One canal. One root. One hour. The procedure is so straightforward that it borders on anticlimactic for patients who've spent days dreading it. The success rate is the highest of any root canal category: 95% or above. And the cost, £600-£800, is the lowest end of the root canal price range.

If there's such a thing as a good root canal to need, this is the one.

## Why Front Teeth Are Different

The anatomy is the whole story. A front tooth has one root containing one canal. Compare that to a premolar (one or two canals), a lower molar (two or three), or an upper molar (three or four, sometimes more). Each additional canal multiplies the time, the complexity, and the cost.

A single canal in a front tooth is typically straight, wide, and easy to access. The dentist can see directly into the back of the tooth without the contortions required to reach a molar at the back of the mouth. The instruments navigate the canal in a direct line from the crown to the root tip. There are fewer anatomical surprises: no hidden canals lurking behind other canals, no tight curves that challenge the flexibility of the files.

The root itself is usually conical and predictable. The X-ray shows the full length of the canal clearly, and the relationship to surrounding structures (the nasal cavity for upper front teeth, the mental nerve for lower ones) is straightforward to assess.

All of this adds up to a procedure that is faster, more predictable, and more forgiving than a root canal on any other tooth in the mouth.

## The Procedure

The sequence is the same as any [root canal](/blog/what-is-root-canal-treatment), just compressed.

Local anaesthetic numbs the tooth completely. For front teeth, this typically involves an injection into the gum above (or below) the tooth and possibly a supplementary injection into the palate or the gum on the inner side. Full numbness takes 2-3 minutes.

The dentist accesses the canal through the back surface of the tooth (the side facing the tongue). This means the access hole isn't visible when you smile, which matters for cosmetic reasons. A small hole is drilled through the enamel and dentin into the pulp chamber.

The infected or dead pulp tissue is removed from the canal using fine instruments called files. These are thin, flexible metal tools that scrape the walls of the canal clean. In a front tooth, this process is methodical but quick: the canal is straight and cooperates with the instruments.

The canal is irrigated with an antiseptic solution (usually sodium hypochlorite) to kill any remaining bacteria and dissolve organic debris. The irrigant flushes through the canal repeatedly during the cleaning process.

Once the canal is clean, it's dried and filled with a rubber-like material called gutta-percha, sealed with a cement that bonds to the canal walls. A filling closes the access hole in the back of the tooth.

Total time: 45-75 minutes for most front teeth. Some dentists complete the entire procedure in a single visit. Others prefer two visits: one for cleaning and medicating the canal, and a second for filling and sealing. Both approaches work well.

## The Cost

Front tooth root canals sit at the lower end of the root canal price spectrum:

| Treatment | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Front tooth root canal | £600-£800 |
| Premolar root canal | £700-£900 |
| Molar root canal | £1,000-£1,400 |
| Specialist endodontist (any tooth) | Add 30-40% |

The lower cost reflects the simpler anatomy, shorter procedure time, and higher predictability. A general dentist is well-equipped to handle front tooth root canals; specialist endodontist referral is less common for these teeth than for complex molars.

After the root canal, the tooth needs restoring. For front teeth, this is where the decision branches.

A composite filling alone is sometimes sufficient if the tooth structure is largely intact. The access hole through the back of the tooth is small, and a filling can restore the tooth without a crown. Cost: included in the root canal fee or £99-£250 separately.

A [crown](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) is recommended if the tooth has significant structural loss from decay, or if there's concern about the tooth darkening over time (more on this below). A porcelain or ceramic crown on a front tooth provides both structural protection and aesthetic control. Cost: £400-£650.

A [porcelain veneer](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk) is an alternative to a crown for front teeth with intact back surfaces. The veneer covers the visible front face of the tooth, improving the colour match if the tooth has darkened. Cost: [£695 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

## The Colour Question

This is the concern that's unique to front teeth. A root canal treated tooth can darken over time, turning grey, yellow, or brownish compared to its neighbours. This happens because the blood supply inside the tooth has been removed, and residual blood products in the dentin break down and stain the tooth from the inside.

The discolouration isn't inevitable. Thorough cleaning of the pulp chamber during the root canal reduces the amount of residual blood product available to stain the dentin. Modern techniques specifically address this, and many root canal treated front teeth maintain their colour well.

When discolouration does occur, internal bleaching is an effective treatment. The dentist opens the back of the tooth, places a bleaching agent inside the pulp chamber, and seals it in for a few days. The bleach lightens the dentin from within, matching the tooth to its neighbours. This may need repeating once or twice. Cost: £100-£300 per cycle.

Alternatively, a crown or veneer covers the tooth's surface entirely, eliminating any colour mismatch regardless of what's happening to the underlying dentin. For patients who want guaranteed aesthetic control, this is the definitive approach.

The cosmetic management of root canal treated front teeth is a solved problem. Whether through internal bleaching, veneers, or crowns, maintaining the appearance of a front tooth after root canal treatment is entirely achievable.

## Why Front Teeth Need Root Canals

The causes of front tooth pulp damage differ slightly from molars because front teeth are more exposed to certain types of trauma.

**Dental trauma** is the leading cause. A blow to the face from a fall, a sports injury, or an accident can damage the nerve inside a front tooth even if the tooth itself appears intact. The impact disrupts the blood supply to the pulp, which may die days, weeks, or even years later. A tooth that was [knocked](/blog/knocked-out-tooth-what-to-do-uk) or displaced in childhood might need a root canal as a teenager or adult, long after the original injury has been forgotten.

**Deep decay** that reaches the pulp chamber requires root canal treatment the same as any other tooth. Front teeth are slightly less susceptible to decay than molars (simpler anatomy, easier to clean), but cavities on the surfaces between front teeth, often caused by acid erosion or tight contact points, can reach the nerve.

**Previous dental work** can compromise the pulp over time. A front tooth that's had a deep filling, a crown preparation, or [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) may have had its pulp stressed by the preparation process. The pulp can tolerate some trauma but has limits: repeated procedures on the same tooth increase the cumulative risk.

**Discolouration as the first sign** is common with front teeth. The tooth gradually darkens compared to its neighbours, sometimes over months. There's no pain, no sensitivity, no obvious problem. The X-ray reveals a dark shadow at the root tip: an asymptomatic infection from a nerve that died quietly. The root canal in these cases resolves the infection and addresses the darkening simultaneously.

## Recovery

Recovery from a front tooth root canal is the mildest version of root canal recovery.

The tooth is tender for 1-2 days, less than a molar root canal because the procedure is shorter and less invasive. Biting directly on the tooth (into an apple, for instance) produces a wince for a day or two. Ibuprofen and paracetamol handle the discomfort comfortably.

By day three, the tooth feels essentially normal. By the end of the first week, there's no residual tenderness. The transition from "I just had a root canal" to "I forget I had a root canal" is remarkably quick.

[Eating](/blog/eating-after-tooth-extraction) is unrestricted from day one, with the common-sense exception of biting directly into hard foods with the treated tooth for the first few days. This is a practical limitation rather than a medical one: the tooth is tender, not fragile.

## The Assessment

The consultation for a potential front tooth root canal is quick and informative. An X-ray shows the full length of the root and canal, any infection at the tip, and the amount of remaining tooth structure. The dentist tests the nerve response (cold test, electric pulp test) to determine whether the nerve is alive, dying, or dead.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and if the diagnosis is root canal, treatment can often begin the same day. For patients with [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options), [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) is available at [£399](/pricing), though many patients find that a front tooth root canal under local anaesthetic is comfortable enough that sedation isn't necessary.

Front teeth occupy the most visible real estate in your smile. Saving one with a root canal preserves the natural tooth, the natural root, and the natural alignment of the arch. An hour in the chair, a few days of mild tenderness, and the tooth carries on as if nothing happened. For a procedure with such a fearsome reputation, the front tooth version is remarkably undramatic.
