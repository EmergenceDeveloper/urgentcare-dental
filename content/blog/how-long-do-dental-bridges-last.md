The bridge has been doing its job for years. Sitting quietly in the mouth, filling the gap, looking like teeth, working like teeth. And now there's something different. A slight movement. A sensitivity in one of the anchor teeth. A dark line at the gum margin. And the question: is this the beginning of the end?

[Dental bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) are designed to be long-term restorations, and they deliver on that design. The average lifespan of a well-made bridge is 10-15 years, with plenty lasting 20 years or more. They're not permanent in the way a [dental implant](/blog/how-long-do-dental-implants-last) can be, but they're a solid decade-plus investment that provides function and aesthetics throughout.

Understanding what influences that lifespan, and what the warning signs of failure look like, turns bridge ownership from a passive experience into an informed one.

## The Lifespan Numbers

Research on bridge longevity consistently reports survival rates of:

- 90-95% at 5 years
- 85-90% at 10 years
- 75-85% at 15 years
- 65-75% at 20 years

These numbers represent all bridges, across all patients and all clinical situations. Individual bridge lifespan varies enormously based on the factors discussed below. A three-unit bridge on healthy anchor teeth, maintained well, can reasonably last 20+ years. A long-span bridge on compromised anchor teeth may need replacing within 7-10 years.

## What Determines How Long a Bridge Lasts

**The anchor teeth** (abutments) are the foundation. A bridge is only as strong as the teeth that support it. Anchor teeth that are structurally sound, with healthy roots, good bone support, and no pre-existing problems, provide a stable foundation that lasts. Anchor teeth that are already compromised (large [fillings](/blog/how-long-do-fillings-last), [root canal treatments](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), reduced bone support from [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices)) are more likely to fail, taking the bridge with them.

**The span** of the bridge matters. A three-unit bridge (one missing tooth with an anchor tooth on each side) is the most common and most predictable configuration. Longer spans (replacing two or more missing teeth) put more stress on the anchor teeth because each chewing force is transmitted through fewer points of contact. The longer the span, the more leverage acts on the anchors, and the shorter the expected lifespan.

**The location** in the mouth affects longevity. Bridges in the front of the mouth (replacing incisors or canines) experience lower biting forces and tend to last longer. Bridges in the back of the mouth (replacing premolars or molars) absorb the full force of chewing and are more susceptible to fatigue and failure.

**Oral hygiene** around the bridge is the single most modifiable factor. The junction between bridge and natural tooth is a critical zone: bacteria accumulate here, and if not cleaned effectively, decay develops at the margins. Decay at the anchor tooth margins is the leading cause of bridge failure. Flossing under the bridge (using a floss threader or superfloss) is essential and often neglected.

**[Teeth grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions)** dramatically shortens bridge lifespan. The sustained, heavy forces of bruxism stress the cement bond, the porcelain, and the anchor teeth simultaneously. Grinders should wear a night guard to protect their bridge investment.

**The quality of the fit** at the margins determines how resistant the bridge is to bacterial penetration. A bridge that fits with microscopic precision at the gum line leaves no gap for bacteria. A bridge with marginal gaps, even small ones, provides entry points for bacteria that lead to decay over time.

## How Bridges Fail

**Decay at the anchor teeth** is the most common failure mode, accounting for approximately 40% of bridge replacements. The bridge itself is intact: it's the tooth beneath the crown that's failing. Bacteria have penetrated the margin between crown and tooth, establishing decay that undermines the anchor. By the time the decay is detected, it may be extensive enough that the anchor tooth needs [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) or [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk).

**Cement washout** occurs when the cement holding the bridge to the anchor teeth gradually dissolves. This is a slow process, but over a decade or more, the cement can lose its integrity, allowing the bridge to loosen. The first sign is often a strange taste or smell (bacteria entering the gap between bridge and tooth) or a slight movement when pressing on the bridge.

**Porcelain fracture** is the most visible failure. A piece of the porcelain facing chips or breaks away, revealing the metal or zirconia framework beneath. Small chips can sometimes be repaired with composite resin (cost: £50-£150). Larger fractures, particularly those that affect function or aesthetics, require bridge replacement.

**Anchor tooth fracture** is the most serious failure. The anchor tooth itself cracks, usually at the junction between natural tooth and crown margin. If the fracture extends below the gum line, the tooth typically needs extraction, which means the bridge is lost and the gap is now wider, requiring a new, longer bridge or an alternative replacement.

**Periodontal failure** occurs when [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) destroys the bone supporting the anchor teeth. As bone loss progresses, the anchor teeth become mobile, and the bridge becomes unstable. Treating the gum disease stabilises the situation, but if bone loss is severe, the anchor teeth may eventually be lost.

## The Warning Signs

**Movement or rocking** when you press on the bridge indicates loosening. This may be cement failure, anchor tooth decay, or bone loss. Early assessment prevents the situation from worsening.

**A strange taste or bad smell** around the bridge suggests bacteria have entered the gap between bridge and tooth. This is often the first sign of cement washout or marginal decay.

**Sensitivity in an anchor tooth** to temperature or pressure indicates potential decay, a crack, or nerve damage. Since the anchor tooth is covered by a crown, the sensitivity may feel different from a normal cavity: deeper, less localised, harder to pin down.

**Dark lines at the gum** around the anchor teeth. On metal-based bridges, a grey shadow at the gum is cosmetic (the metal core showing through thinning gum tissue). On all-ceramic bridges, a dark line suggests decay at the margin.

**Food getting trapped** around the bridge in a new pattern indicates that the fit has changed, either from gum recession exposing the margins or from the bridge loosening and creating gaps.

## When a Bridge Fails: The Options

**Recementation:** if the bridge has come loose but the anchor teeth are healthy and the bridge is intact, it can often be cleaned and recemented. Cost: £50-£150. This is the simplest and cheapest fix.

**Repair:** chipped porcelain can sometimes be patched with composite bonding. The repair is cosmetic rather than ideal (the composite may not perfectly match the surrounding porcelain), but it's functional and extends the bridge's service life. Cost: £50-£200.

**Replacement bridge:** when the bridge has failed beyond repair, a new bridge is fabricated. The anchor teeth are reassessed, any decay is treated, and new impressions are taken. Cost: [similar to the original bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), typically £1,500-£3,000.

**Transition to implants:** when an anchor tooth has been lost, the remaining span is too long for a new bridge, or the patient wants a more permanent solution, [dental implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) replace the bridge with individual, freestanding teeth. Cost: [£1,999 per implant at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

## Bridges vs Implants: The Longevity Perspective

The [bridge vs implant decision](/blog/dental-implant-vs-bridge-cost-comparison) has a significant longevity dimension.

A bridge lasts 10-15 years (average). An [implant lasts 20-25 years](/blog/how-long-do-dental-implants-last) and frequently lasts a lifetime. Over a 30-year period, a bridge may need replacing twice (original plus two replacements: £4,500-£9,000 total), while an implant may need only the crown component replaced once (original implant £1,999-£3,000, crown replacement £400-£650).

The bridge also requires preparing two healthy teeth as anchors, removing enamel from teeth that were previously intact. If the bridge fails and an anchor tooth is lost, the situation is worse than the original single missing tooth.

The implant preserves neighbouring teeth completely and maintains [bone density](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) at the implant site. It's a more conservative approach to tooth replacement, despite the higher initial cost.

## Maintaining a Bridge

Brushing at the gum line around the anchor teeth removes plaque from the critical margins. An interdental brush or small-headed brush reaches areas that a standard toothbrush misses.

Flossing under the pontic (the false tooth suspended between the anchors) removes debris that accumulates between the bridge and the gum. Superfloss (a floss with a stiff threader end, a spongy middle, and regular floss) is designed specifically for this: the threader goes under the bridge, the spongy section cleans the underside, and the floss cleans the anchor contacts.

Regular check-ups (every 6-12 months) include assessment of the bridge margins, probing around the anchor teeth, and X-rays to detect decay beneath the crowns. Early detection of problems means simpler, cheaper solutions.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), bridge assessment is part of every [check-up](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk). If problems are detected, the options, from recementation to repair to replacement, are discussed with full cost transparency.

A bridge that's well-made, well-fitted, and well-maintained is a reliable, long-lasting restoration. Understanding what keeps it lasting, and what threatens it, is the difference between a bridge that serves 20 years and one that fails at 7. Most of that difference comes down to cleaning and check-ups. Simple things, done consistently.
