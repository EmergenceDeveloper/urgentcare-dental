You need more than one tooth out. Maybe three, maybe five, maybe more. And the question forming in your mind is whether this means three, five, or more separate appointments, each with its own round of anxiety, each with its own recovery period, each with its own cleared diary and stocked-up soft food supplies.

The answer, for most people, is no. Multiple teeth can be extracted in a single appointment. Dentists do it routinely. And for a lot of patients, combining everything into one session is actually the better path: one round of anaesthesia, one recovery period, one block of time off work, and the whole thing is done.

How many teeth can come out in one visit depends on clinical factors, patient preference, and the practical realities of the procedures involved. But the range is wider than most people expect: removing four wisdom teeth in one session is common, and full-mouth extractions of ten or more teeth happen regularly for patients who need [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) or [implants](/blog/full-mouth-dental-implants-cost-uk).

## How Many Is Too Many?

There's no hard clinical limit on how many teeth can be extracted in one appointment. The decision is guided by:

**The complexity of each extraction.** Four [simple extractions](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction) are a different proposition from four [surgical extractions](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk). Simple extractions take 15-20 minutes each, so four might total an hour. Surgical extractions take 30-45 minutes each, so four could mean 2-3 hours in the chair. The total surgical time determines what's feasible in a single session.

**The location of the teeth.** Extracting teeth from opposite sides of the mouth means numbing both sides, which can leave the patient uncomfortable and unable to feel their entire lower face. Some dentists prefer to do one side at a time for this reason, while others are comfortable numbing both sides in one session, especially under [sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk).

**The patient's medical history.** Conditions that affect bleeding (blood disorders, blood-thinning medications) may make it prudent to limit the number of surgical sites in one session. The dentist assesses clotting risk and adjusts the plan accordingly.

**The patient's preference.** Some people want everything done at once, no matter how many teeth are involved. Others prefer to break it into stages. Both approaches are valid, and the dentist accommodates either.

For most patients needing 2-4 extractions, a single appointment is standard. For 5-10 extractions, a single appointment is common under sedation. For full-mouth clearances (10+ teeth), the decision depends on the clinical complexity and whether the patient is having [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) or [implants](/blog/full-mouth-dental-implants-cost-uk) fitted at the same time.

## Why One Session Makes Sense

Combining multiple extractions into a single visit has several practical advantages.

**One recovery period.** Four teeth extracted over four separate appointments means four separate recoveries, each with its own 3-5 day period of soft food and soreness. Four teeth extracted in one appointment means one recovery period of 5-7 days. The total recovery time is shorter, even though the single recovery is slightly more intense.

**One round of anxiety.** For patients with [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options), the build-up to a dental appointment is often worse than the appointment itself. Reducing four anxious build-ups to one is a significant psychological benefit. Under [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like), the entire experience compresses to: cannula in, calm wave, told it's done.

**Cost efficiency.** At most practices, the sedation fee is per session, not per tooth. One session of IV sedation covering four extractions costs the same as one session covering one extraction. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [extraction with sedation package is £695](/pricing). Getting four teeth out under sedation in one visit means one sedation fee, not four.

**Less time off work.** Four separate appointments mean four separate half-days (at minimum) away from work, plus four separate recovery periods. One combined appointment means one block of time off: the procedure day plus 2-3 days of recovery.

## The Sedation Advantage

[IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) transforms the experience of multiple extractions. It's the single biggest factor in making larger procedures manageable.

Under sedation, a 2-hour session involving four wisdom tooth extractions passes in what feels like five minutes. The patient is deeply relaxed, cooperative, and amnesic: they won't remember the procedure. The dentist works efficiently without the interruptions that come from an anxious patient needing breaks.

For someone who's been avoiding dental care for years and has accumulated multiple teeth that need extracting, sedation is often the thing that makes the whole situation possible. Not just tolerable. Possible. The person who couldn't face one extraction under local anaesthetic finds they can have four under sedation, because the experience they dreaded simply doesn't register.

At UrgentCare Dental, the [£399 IV sedation fee](/pricing) covers the entire session. Whether one tooth or four teeth come out, the sedation cost is the same. The extraction costs are per tooth on top.

## Full Mouth Extractions

Full-mouth extraction, removing all remaining teeth, is typically done in preparation for [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) or [full-mouth implants](/blog/full-mouth-dental-implants-cost-uk).

The number of teeth varies: some patients have a full set of 28 (or 32 with wisdom teeth), while patients with a history of dental problems may have 10-15 remaining teeth. The procedure is planned carefully, with the replacement teeth (dentures or implant-supported bridges) designed in advance so the patient doesn't go without teeth.

For denture patients, immediate dentures are fabricated before the extractions. The teeth come out, the dentures go in the same day. The dentures will need adjusting as the gums heal and the bone remodels over the following months, but the patient is never toothless.

For implant patients, the [All-on-4](/blog/all-on-4-dental-implants-cost-uk) or [All-on-6](/blog/all-on-6-vs-all-on-4-dental-implants) approach allows extractions and implant placement in the same session. Teeth come out, implants go in, and a temporary bridge is fitted immediately. One procedure, one recovery, and you leave with teeth.

Full-mouth extractions are almost always performed under IV sedation or, for complex cases, general anaesthetic. The procedure takes 2-4 hours, and the patient recovers at home over the following week to ten days.

## Recovery After Multiple Extractions

Recovery from multiple extractions follows the same pattern as single extraction recovery, with some differences in intensity.

Swelling is more widespread. Multiple extraction sites mean more surgical trauma, which produces more inflammatory response. If both sides of the mouth were operated on, both cheeks may be swollen. The swelling peaks at 48 hours and resolves over the following 5-7 days.

Pain management requires the same approach (ibuprofen and paracetamol alternating) but is more important to maintain consistently. Missing a dose when multiple sites are healing is more noticeable than with a single extraction.

[Eating](/blog/eating-after-tooth-extraction) requires more creativity when both sides of the mouth are recovering simultaneously. The first few days are genuinely soft-food-only: smoothies, yoghurt, mashed potato, soup. There's no "good side" to chew on when both sides are healing. Most people find this phase manageable but boring.

The total recovery time is marginally longer than a single extraction: 7-10 days to feel mostly normal, compared to 5-7 for a single tooth. By two weeks, the difference between single and multiple extraction recovery is negligible.

## The Costs

Multiple extraction costs add up per tooth, with economies coming from the shared appointment and sedation fees.

| Scenario | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 2 simple extractions | £200-£600 |
| 4 wisdom teeth (surgical) | £800-£2,400 |
| 4 wisdom teeth with sedation at UCD | ~£2,196 + £399 sedation |
| Full mouth clearance (10+ teeth) | £1,500-£5,000 |
| Full mouth with immediate dentures | £3,000-£8,000 |

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the per-tooth pricing is transparent, and the [IV sedation fee of £399](/pricing) covers the entire session regardless of how many teeth are removed. This makes the combined cost of multiple extractions under sedation significantly more affordable than having each tooth done separately with separate sedation.

## The Conversation

If you need multiple teeth out, the consultation is where the plan gets built.

The dentist reviews X-rays of all the teeth in question, assesses the complexity of each extraction (simple or surgical), and designs the treatment plan: how many teeth per session, what type of anaesthesia or sedation, and what the replacement plan looks like if applicable.

For patients with [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-phobia-help-uk) or a backlog of dental problems they've been avoiding, this consultation can be genuinely emotional. Years of deferred treatment, years of worsening problems, and now a clear plan to resolve all of it, sometimes in a single session.

At UrgentCare Dental, the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and the consultation for planned extractions covers the full assessment, X-rays, and treatment planning. The conversation includes costs, timing, sedation options, and replacement plans for any visible teeth.

Multiple extractions sound daunting. One appointment, one recovery, and the problems are solved. When you frame it like that, doing it all at once starts to sound less like an ordeal and more like efficiency.

And efficiency, when it comes to things you'd rather not be doing, is exactly what you want.
