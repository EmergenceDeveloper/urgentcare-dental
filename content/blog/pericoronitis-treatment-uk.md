There's a flap of gum at the back of your mouth that's making your life miserable. It's swollen, tender, and every time you chew, your upper tooth bites down on it. The area behind your last molar is red and angry, there's a taste in your mouth that's somewhere between metallic and rotten, and opening your jaw wide enough to eat a sandwich feels like a stretch too far.

This is pericoronitis. And if you've had it once, you know exactly what's happening because it feels exactly the same every time.

Pericoronitis is the most common complication of wisdom teeth, and it's responsible for more [emergency dental appointments](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) than any other wisdom tooth problem. It's also one of those conditions where the name sounds obscure and clinical, but the experience is dismally familiar to millions of people: a gum infection that flares up, gets treated, settles down, and then comes back. The cycle can repeat for years.

Understanding why it happens, and why it keeps happening, makes the path to breaking the cycle much clearer.

## What's Actually Happening

The anatomy is beautifully simple. A wisdom tooth that's partially erupted has broken through the gum, but the gum hasn't fully receded to expose the whole tooth. A flap of tissue, called the operculum, drapes over the part of the tooth that's still submerged.

That flap creates a pocket. A warm, dark, moist pocket that food particles and bacteria find irresistible. Every meal pushes debris under the flap. Brushing can't reach it. Flossing can't access it. The pocket is essentially uncleanable by normal oral hygiene.

Bacteria colonise the trapped food and multiply. The gum tissue becomes inflamed in response. The inflammation causes swelling, which makes the pocket even deeper and harder to clean. More bacteria, more inflammation, more swelling. The cycle escalates over a few days from "slightly tender" to "I can barely open my mouth."

If the upper wisdom tooth (or any opposing tooth) bites down on the swollen gum flap, it traumatises the tissue further, adding mechanical injury to the infection. This is why pericoronitis often feels worse when eating: every bite compresses the inflamed tissue between the teeth.

## The Two Versions

Pericoronitis comes in two forms, and knowing which one you're dealing with helps calibrate the response.

Acute pericoronitis is the dramatic one. Rapid onset of pain, significant swelling around the wisdom tooth, difficulty opening the mouth (trismus), possibly a fever, and sometimes [facial swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache) spreading beyond the gum into the cheek. This is the version that sends people to the [emergency dentist](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk). It develops over 2-3 days and demands attention.

Chronic pericoronitis is the slow-burn version. Mild, dull discomfort around the wisdom tooth that comes and goes. A slightly bad taste in that area. Occasional tenderness when chewing. It's annoying rather than debilitating, and it's the version that people live with for months or years, never quite bad enough to seek treatment, never quite good enough to forget about.

The chronic form has a habit of converting to acute. A period of stress, illness, or even just eating something that gets particularly wedged under the gum flap can tip the balance from "mild irritation" to "full-blown infection" within 48 hours.

## Treatment: The Immediate Fix

When acute pericoronitis sends you to the dentist, the immediate treatment follows a consistent pattern.

The area gets examined. The dentist checks the extent of the swelling, assesses whether the infection is localised or spreading, and takes an X-ray to see the wisdom tooth's position and whether there are any deeper complications.

Irrigation is often the most immediately helpful thing the dentist does. A syringe loaded with antiseptic solution flushes under the gum flap, washing out the trapped debris and bacteria that are fuelling the infection. The relief can be noticeable within hours.

[Antibiotics](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) are prescribed when the infection is significant: amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for five days is the standard first-line treatment, or metronidazole for penicillin-allergic patients. The antibiotics bring the infection under control within 48-72 hours, and the swelling and pain recede over the following days.

Pain management with ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory) and paracetamol (analgesic) keeps things bearable during the acute phase. The combination is more effective than either alone.

If the opposing upper tooth is biting on the swollen flap and making things worse, the dentist might smooth or slightly adjust the biting surface to reduce the trauma.

This immediate treatment works. Within a week, the area settles. The pain goes. The swelling resolves. The mouth opens normally again.

And then, somewhere between three weeks and six months later, it happens again.

## Why It Keeps Coming Back

This is the crucial bit, and it's the reason pericoronitis drives people to distraction.

The antibiotics clear the infection. The irrigation cleans the pocket. But the anatomy hasn't changed. The gum flap is still there. The pocket is still there. The warm, dark, food-trapping environment that bred the infection in the first place is still there, waiting for the next accumulation of debris to start the whole process again.

Pericoronitis recurrence rates are significant. Studies show that about 40-50% of patients who have a first episode of pericoronitis will have a second episode within three years. Some have three, four, five recurrences, each one following the same pattern: antibiotics, relief, quiet period, recurrence.

Each course of antibiotics costs £9.90 (or free in Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland). Each emergency dental appointment costs [£20 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing). The cumulative cost of managing recurrent pericoronitis, three or four episodes over two years, can approach or exceed the cost of the extraction that would have ended it.

And there's the less visible cost: the uncertainty. Never knowing when the next flare-up will arrive. The cancelled plans, the difficult meals, the low-grade awareness that the back of your mouth is a ticking time bomb.

## The Definitive Solution

Removing the [wisdom tooth](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) removes the operculum, removes the pocket, and removes the environment that breeds pericoronitis. Once the tooth is out, pericoronitis cannot recur. The cycle breaks permanently.

The timing of the extraction matters. Extracting during an active infection is possible but not ideal; the inflamed tissue makes anaesthesia less effective and healing more complicated. The optimal sequence is: antibiotics to settle the infection, then extraction once the area has calmed, typically 1-2 weeks after the acute episode.

Wisdom tooth extraction at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) costs [£549 per tooth](/pricing). With [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk), the combined package is [£695](/pricing). The [recovery takes about a week](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-recovery).

One week of recovery versus years of recurrent infections. That's the trade-off, and for most people who've been through more than one episode of pericoronitis, the calculation is clear.

## Operculectomy: The Middle Ground

There's a procedure that sits between repeated antibiotics and full extraction: operculectomy. The surgeon removes the gum flap itself, leaving the wisdom tooth in place but eliminating the pocket that trapped food and bacteria.

Operculectomy costs £100-£300 and is a simpler procedure than extraction: the gum tissue is excised under local anaesthetic, and the healing takes about a week.

For wisdom teeth that are otherwise healthy and in a good position, operculectomy can be a permanent solution. Remove the flap, remove the pocket, remove the problem. The tooth stays and functions normally.

The limitation: if the wisdom tooth is [impacted](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk), poorly positioned, or likely to cause other problems, operculectomy addresses the pericoronitis but doesn't address the underlying impaction. In these cases, extraction is the more complete solution.

The dentist's recommendation depends on the tooth's position, angle, and long-term prospects. An operculectomy for a well-positioned wisdom tooth that just needs its gum flap removed? That can work beautifully. An operculectomy on a mesioangularly impacted tooth that's pressing against its neighbour? Extraction makes more sense.

## Self-Care During a Flare-Up

While waiting for the dental appointment or for antibiotics to take effect, the flare-up needs managing.

Salt water rinses are the single most helpful home measure for pericoronitis. A teaspoon of salt in warm water, gently swished around the affected area, reduces bacterial load and draws fluid from the swollen tissue. Three to four times daily, particularly after eating.

A water flosser or syringe (without a needle) can flush the pocket under the gum flap, dislodging trapped food that's fuelling the infection. Gentle, warm water, directed at the gap between the gum flap and the tooth. The debris that comes out can be surprisingly substantial, and the relief from removing it is immediate.

Ibuprofen addresses both the pain and the inflammation. Paracetamol adds analgesic coverage on top. The combination, alternated every few hours, manages moderate pericoronitis effectively.

Soft foods that don't require chewing at the back of the mouth reduce the trauma to the swollen gum flap. When the upper tooth is biting down on inflamed tissue, every meal prolongs the problem.

These measures don't fix pericoronitis. They manage it. And the difference between managing it temporarily and fixing it permanently is a dental appointment.

## The Pattern-Breaking Appointment

There's something specific about the appointment where pericoronitis finally gets resolved.

For a lot of people, it's not the first appointment. It's the appointment after the second or third recurrence, the one where they sit in the chair and say something like: "I'm done with this. Just take it out."

That moment, the decision to break the cycle, is the moment things change. The extraction gets booked. The [sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) gets arranged if wanted. And a week or two later, the wisdom tooth is out, the gum flap is gone, and the pocket that caused all those infections is history.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), pericoronitis is one of the most common presentations we see. The swollen gum, the tight jaw, the frustration of "not this again." And the relief when the tooth finally comes out and the cycle breaks for good.

The first episode is managed. The second raises the question. The third usually answers it.

That gum flap has bothered you for the last time.
