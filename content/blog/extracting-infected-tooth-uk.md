You've got an infected tooth. It's been throbbing for days, maybe the face has [swollen up](/blog/swollen-face-toothache), and you've arrived at a decision: get it out. You just want this tooth gone, this problem solved, the pain over.

So you call a dentist and ask the question: can you pull it today?

The answer is yes, with a but. And the "but" is important enough to be worth understanding, because it's the difference between a smooth extraction that heals well and a rougher experience that takes longer to recover from.

A dentist can extract an infected tooth. They have the skills, the instruments, and the clinical licence to do it. What changes is the timing, and the role that [antibiotics](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) play in making the extraction go as well as it possibly can.

## Why Timing Matters

An infected tooth sits in inflamed tissue. The gum around it is swollen, angry, and flooded with immune cells fighting the bacteria. The bone around the root may be softened by the infection. And here's the clinically relevant part: local anaesthetic works less effectively in inflamed, acidic tissue.

Dental anaesthetics are designed to work in tissue at a normal pH level. Infection creates an acidic environment around the tooth, and that acidity reduces the anaesthetic's ability to block nerve signals. Which means numbing an infected area is harder, sometimes significantly harder, than numbing a healthy one.

This doesn't mean you'll feel pain during the extraction. It means the dentist might need to use more anaesthetic, use alternative nerve-blocking techniques, or work in an area that's not as deeply numb as they'd ideally want it to be. It's manageable, but it's not optimal.

Beyond the anaesthetic challenge, extracting from inflamed tissue means more bleeding (inflamed tissue has increased blood flow), more difficult healing (the socket is already compromised by infection), and a higher chance of post-operative complications.

All of which is why the preferred sequence is: [antibiotics first](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk), settle the infection over 3-7 days, then extract the tooth from healthy, calm tissue where the anaesthetic works perfectly and the healing is straightforward.

## When Immediate Extraction Happens Anyway

The antibiotics-first approach is ideal, but it's not always the path that makes sense.

If the infection has created a large, drainable [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency), extracting the tooth immediately can serve as drainage. The tooth comes out, the pus drains through the empty socket, and the infection starts resolving from the moment the source is removed. In this scenario, the extraction is the treatment for the infection, not a separate procedure that follows it.

If the patient is in severe pain that isn't responding to medication, and the tooth is clearly beyond saving, a same-day extraction might be the most compassionate option. Sending someone home for a week of antibiotics while they're in agony isn't always the right call if the tooth can be safely removed now.

If the infection isn't responding to oral antibiotics (some people have been through two or three courses without resolution), removing the source, the tooth, can be more effective than another round of medication. The antibiotics are fighting a losing battle because the source of bacteria is still sitting there, continually reseeding the infection.

The decision is always clinical, made by the dentist based on the specific situation: the severity of the infection, the patient's pain level, the tooth's condition, and the likelihood of complications either way.

## What the Extraction Looks Like

An infected tooth extraction follows the same basic procedure as any extraction, with a few adaptations.

The dentist administers local anaesthetic, potentially using more than usual or employing a different injection technique to overcome the pH challenges. An inferior alveolar nerve block (for lower teeth) delivers anaesthetic to the nerve trunk before it reaches the infected area, bypassing the acidic tissue entirely. For upper teeth, infiltration anaesthesia around the tooth is standard, sometimes supplemented with additional injections.

For patients who are anxious about the extraction, especially given the infection and the pain they've been experiencing, [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk) is available. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the combined extraction and sedation package is [£695](/pricing). Under sedation, the procedure happens, the infection source is removed, and you don't remember any of it.

Once the area is numb, the dentist uses an elevator to loosen the tooth in its socket. Infected teeth are sometimes easier to extract than healthy ones, because the infection has already softened the bone and loosened the ligaments holding the tooth in place. The tooth may come out more readily than expected.

After the tooth is removed, the socket is cleaned to remove any remaining infected tissue or debris. If there's an abscess cavity, the dentist may irrigate it with antiseptic solution. Stitches might close the site if needed.

The extraction itself, once the anaesthetic is working, takes 15-45 minutes depending on the tooth. [Wisdom teeth](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) and multi-rooted molars take longer than single-rooted front teeth.

## Recovery After Extracting an Infected Tooth

Recovery from extracting an infected tooth is slightly different from a routine extraction, mainly because the area was already inflamed before the procedure.

Swelling may persist for a few days longer than with a standard extraction. The tissue was already inflamed from the infection, and the extraction adds surgical inflammation on top. Peak swelling typically occurs at 48-72 hours.

Antibiotics continue after the extraction if they were prescribed before it. The course should be completed even if the tooth is out and you feel better. The remaining antibiotics clear any bacteria that spread beyond the tooth before it was removed.

Pain management follows the same pattern as any extraction: ibuprofen and paracetamol alternating, with stronger prescription painkillers available if needed. The pain from the infection usually resolves quickly once the source is removed. Many people report that the post-extraction discomfort is actually less than the infected-tooth pain that preceded it.

Full healing of the socket takes 1-2 weeks for the soft tissue closure, and 6-8 weeks for the bone beneath. The [recovery timeline](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-recovery) is well-documented and predictable: peak discomfort at 48 hours, improvement from day four, and return to normal eating by day seven.

## The Costs

An [emergency dental appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk) to assess an infected tooth costs [£20 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), or £50-£200 at most UK practices.

The extraction itself costs £100-£300 for a straightforward removal. Surgical extractions of more complex teeth run £200-£600. [Wisdom tooth](/pricing) extractions at UrgentCare Dental are £549.

With [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like), the combined package at UrgentCare Dental is [£695](/pricing).

Antibiotics, if prescribed: £9.90 per prescription in England.

The total for resolving an infected tooth by extraction, including the emergency appointment, antibiotics, and the extraction itself, typically falls between £130-£800 depending on the tooth's location and complexity.

Compare that to the cost of saving the tooth with [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) (£300-£700 plus a crown at £500-£1,000), and extraction is the more affordable route. The trade-off is a gap where a tooth used to be, which may eventually need filling with an [implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) (£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental), a bridge (£700-£1,500), or a [partial denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) (£500-£1,500).

## The Conversation You'll Have

When you sit in the dental chair with an infected tooth, the conversation with the dentist will cover three things.

First: the current state of the infection. How severe is it? Is there drainable pus? Has it spread to the face? This determines whether antibiotics need to work first or whether extraction can happen now.

Second: whether the tooth can be saved. A root canal preserves the tooth. An extraction removes it permanently. The dentist will recommend based on how much viable tooth structure remains, the extent of the infection, and whether the tooth can be effectively restored.

Third: the timing. If antibiotics first, the extraction gets booked for 5-10 days later. If extraction today, the procedure and recovery are discussed immediately.

This conversation takes ten minutes. It turns a situation that feels overwhelming into a clear plan with defined steps, costs, and timelines. The infection that's been dominating your days has a resolution date.

## After the Tooth Is Gone

There's a particular relief that comes with extracting an infected tooth. It's immediate and specific.

The constant throbbing stops. The swelling begins to subside. The foul taste disappears. Within 24 hours, the difference between "infected tooth" and "healing socket" is dramatic. The socket is sore, yes, but it's a clean, healing kind of sore, fundamentally different from the deep, pulsing ache of infection.

Within a week, most people feel genuinely good. The area is settling, the antibiotics (if still being taken) are mopping up the last of the infection, and the mouth is returning to normal.

And then, running the tongue along the gap where the problem tooth used to be, there's a quiet satisfaction. The tooth that caused all that pain, all those sleepless nights, all that swelling: it's gone. The problem is solved in the most definitive way possible.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), extracting infected teeth is one of the most common emergency procedures. The relief on patients' faces when the tooth is out, when the source of their suffering is sitting on a tray rather than sitting in their jaw, is something the team sees every single day.

The infection is over. The tooth is out. And the healing, genuine healing, starts right there in the chair.
