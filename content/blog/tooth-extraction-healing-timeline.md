The tooth is out. The dentist has put the gauze in, given you the aftercare sheet, and sent you on your way. And now you're sitting with a numb face, a mouth that tastes of blood, and a question that's going to dominate the next week of your life: is this normal?

The answer, for almost everything you're about to experience, is yes. Tooth extraction healing follows a pattern so consistent that dentists could practically write your diary for the next seven days. The swelling, the soreness, the weird tastes, the moment things turn the corner: it all happens on schedule.

Knowing that schedule in advance is genuinely calming. Instead of panicking every time something feels odd, you're ticking off checkpoints. Day two swelling? Check. Day four improvement? Check. Day seven, practically normal? Check.

## The First Few Hours

The local anaesthetic keeps the area numb for 2-4 hours. During this time, the extraction site is bleeding (normal), the blood clot is forming (essential), and you're biting on gauze that's absorbing the blood and applying gentle pressure to help the clot solidify.

The gauze comes out after about 30-45 minutes. If the bleeding has slowed to a slight ooze, you're done with gauze. If it's still flowing, a fresh piece for another 30 minutes usually does the job. The blood mixing with saliva looks like far more blood than it actually is, a classic optical illusion that unsettles everyone but is genuinely harmless.

This is the time to take ibuprofen and paracetamol, before the anaesthetic wears off. Getting the painkillers into your system while you're still numb means they're working by the time sensation returns. The transition from "numb" to "aware of what just happened" is much smoother with medication already on board.

The blood clot that forms in the socket during these first hours is the foundation of everything that follows. It's a biological scaffold: a matrix of blood cells, platelets, and proteins that protects the exposed bone, prevents infection, and provides the framework for new tissue to grow. Protecting this clot is the single most important thing during early recovery.

Protecting the clot means: no rinsing, spitting, or using straws for the first 24 hours. No smoking (the suction motion and the chemicals in smoke both threaten the clot). No poking the socket with your tongue (harder than it sounds, because your tongue is magnetically drawn to the gap). No hot food or drinks (heat encourages bleeding).

## Day One

Once the anaesthetic wears off, the picture becomes clearer. There's soreness at the extraction site, a dull ache that ibuprofen and paracetamol handle well. The jaw feels stiff, particularly if it was held open wide during the extraction. The area might feel bruised.

Eating is a gentle affair. Soft, cool foods work best: yoghurt, ice cream, mashed potato, soup (lukewarm, not hot). The other side of your mouth is perfectly functional, so it's not a liquid diet. It's just eating with one side while the other heals.

Some people notice a slight ooze of blood throughout day one, particularly after eating or drinking. This is the clot settling in and is completely normal. It usually stops by the evening.

Sleep can be slightly disrupted on the first night. The soreness might wake you once or twice. Sleeping with an extra pillow, keeping the head elevated, reduces blood flow to the area and minimises both throbbing and overnight swelling.

## Day Two: The Swelling Arrives

Swelling peaks at 48 hours. This is the day when looking in the mirror produces a small shock, because the face can look noticeably different on the extraction side. The cheek might be puffy. The jawline might be softer. If a lower molar was removed, there might be swelling visible from the outside.

This is the body's inflammatory response to surgery, and it's entirely normal. It looks dramatic. It's not dangerous. Cold compresses help: 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off.

The soreness on day two is usually the most intense. The extraction site throbs in time with your heartbeat. Moving the jaw, yawning, or trying to open wide can pull on healing tissue and produce a sharp reminder that something happened here recently. Keeping up the regular painkiller schedule (alternating ibuprofen and paracetamol every 3-4 hours) keeps things manageable.

Gentle salt water rinses can begin on day two (check with your dentist for their specific guidance). A teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water, gently swished around the mouth and allowed to fall out rather than spat. The salt water reduces bacteria, soothes inflammation, and helps keep food debris away from the socket.

## Days Three and Four: The Turn

Somewhere between day three and day four, something shifts. The swelling starts to recede. The soreness drops from a persistent presence to an occasional awareness. The jaw loosens slightly.

This is the healing gaining momentum. New tissue is growing across the socket surface. The blood clot is maturing into granulation tissue, a dense, nutrient-rich structure that brings blood supply and growth factors to the healing site. Under the microscope, this tissue is remarkably active, building the framework for new gum tissue to form.

You'll notice the socket looks different now. Instead of a dark blood clot, it might appear whitish or yellowish. This alarms people because it looks like infection, but it's almost certainly granulation tissue or a normal fibrin clot: the body's natural wound covering. It's healthy and expected.

Eating becomes more varied around day four. Pasta, soft bread, cooked vegetables, fish. Anything that doesn't require aggressive chewing or create sharp fragments (crisps, nuts, and crusty bread are still worth avoiding). The extraction side of the mouth starts to feel usable again, though you'll instinctively favour the other side.

## Days Five to Seven: Almost There

By the end of the first week, most people describe themselves as "fine but a bit aware of it." The socket is no longer painful, just sensitive. The swelling has resolved or nearly so. The jaw moves freely. Normal meals are back on the menu with the exception of very hard or crunchy foods directly on the extraction site.

Painkillers become optional for most people by day five. Some take them before bed just for comfort. Many have stopped entirely.

If dissolvable stitches were placed, they start to loosen and dissolve around day seven to ten. Little thread ends appear in your mouth while eating or brushing, which is mildly strange but harmless. They dissolve completely over the following few days.

The hole in the gum is still visible, and your tongue will continue its obsessive exploration of the new geography. But the tenderness has faded enough that the exploration is interesting rather than uncomfortable.

## Weeks Two to Four: The Quiet Healing

The surface heals remarkably quickly. By two weeks, new gum tissue has covered most of the socket opening. The gum is still slightly indented where the tooth was, but it's pink, healthy, and no longer sensitive.

Underneath the surface, bone healing is the slower process. The body is remodelling the socket, gradually filling it with new bone tissue. This takes 6-8 weeks for the initial bone formation and several months for the bone to fully mature and reach its final density.

You won't feel the bone healing happening. By two weeks, the extraction site is essentially symptom-free. Normal eating, normal brushing, normal life. The only evidence that anything happened is the slight depression in the gum and the absence of a tooth.

## When Something Doesn't Feel Right

The vast majority of extractions heal beautifully without complication. But knowing the warning signs means catching the rare problems early.

Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is the most common complication, occurring in about 2-5% of extractions. It happens when the blood clot is lost or doesn't form properly, leaving bone exposed. The defining symptom is a sudden increase in pain on days 3-5, just when things should be getting better. The pain is intense, often radiating to the ear and temple, and over-the-counter painkillers barely touch it.

Dry socket treatment is straightforward: the dentist places a medicated dressing directly in the socket, providing almost immediate relief. The dressing is changed every few days until the socket starts healing on its own. It adds about a week to the recovery timeline but resolves completely.

Infection after extraction is uncommon but possible. Signs include increasing pain after the first few days, swelling that gets worse rather than better, fever, and a foul taste or discharge from the socket. Antibiotics resolve most post-extraction infections quickly.

Persistent bleeding beyond the first day, bright red blood that won't stop with gauze pressure, warrants a call to the dentist. Some ooze is normal. Active flow that continues isn't.

For any of these concerns, the starting point is always a call to the practice that did the extraction. Post-operative complications are part of the service, and the dentist wants to know if something isn't healing as expected.

## The Cost of Recovery

The extraction itself is the main cost. Recovery costs very little beyond what's already in your medicine cabinet.

Ibuprofen and paracetamol: a few pounds from any pharmacy.

Salt for rinses: you probably already have this.

Soft foods: yoghurt, soup, and eggs are among the cheapest foods in the supermarket. Recovery eating is actually less expensive than normal eating.

If a follow-up appointment is needed (for stitches, dry socket treatment, or checking a difficult healing site), most practices include this in the original extraction fee. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), post-operative care for complications is part of the treatment pathway.

The extraction costs at UrgentCare Dental start from competitive rates, with [wisdom tooth extractions at £549](/pricing) and [extraction with IV sedation at £695](/pricing). The recovery costs almost nothing on top of that.

## The New Normal

There's a moment, usually around the two-week mark, when you realise you've stopped thinking about the extraction site. Your tongue has finished its survey of the new territory. The gap has become familiar. Eating is completely normal. The whole experience has receded into the background of your life.

The gap itself might need addressing long-term. A missing tooth, particularly a visible one, can be replaced with a [dental implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) (£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental), a [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) (£700-£1,500), or a [partial denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) (£500-£1,500). For back teeth that aren't visible, some people choose to leave the gap, which is functionally fine as long as the remaining teeth aren't drifting.

But that's a decision for after the healing is complete. Right now, the extraction is done, the recovery is following its reliable schedule, and the tooth that was causing trouble is gone.

The socket heals. The bone fills in. The gum smooths over. And the body, as it does with remarkable efficiency, turns a surgical site into just another part of your mouth that you never think about.

That's what healing looks like. Predictable, manageable, and temporary. Every uncomfortable moment has a reason, a timeline, and an end point. And the end point, every time, is normal.
