The question comes up constantly in implant consultations, and it's always asked the same way, with the same slightly braced expression: "I smoke. Can I still have an implant?"

The short answer is yes. Smokers receive [dental implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) successfully every day. The longer answer, which is the one worth understanding, involves a fascinating collision between the biology of bone healing and the chemistry of cigarette smoke, and it changes the conversation in ways that are genuinely useful to know going in.

## The Biology That Matters

Here's what's happening inside the jaw after an implant is placed. The titanium screw sits in a hole drilled into the bone. Over the next three to six months, something remarkable occurs: the bone doesn't just heal around the implant, it grows directly onto its surface. Cells called osteoblasts migrate to the titanium, lay down new bone matrix, and gradually fuse the implant into the jaw. This process, osseointegration, is what transforms a metal screw into something that functions like a tooth root. It bears chewing forces. It lasts decades. It becomes, in a biological sense, part of the jaw.

Osseointegration is demanding. It requires robust blood supply, healthy immune response, and the sustained biological activity of bone-forming cells working at their best. The bone around the implant site needs oxygen, nutrients, and the full cooperation of the body's healing systems.

And this is where smoking enters the picture.

## What Cigarettes Do to the Healing Process

Nicotine constricts blood vessels. The small vessels that supply the jawbone narrow, reducing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to exactly the area that needs them most. The osteoblasts, the cells doing the critical work of fusing bone to titanium, are working with a diminished supply line. They function less efficiently. The integration slows.

The chemicals in cigarette smoke also suppress the local immune response. The surgical site, which under normal conditions would mount a clean, controlled inflammatory response (inflammation is part of healing, not a failure of it), instead sees a muted, less effective immune reaction. Post-surgical infections are more common. The body's ability to manage the normal bacterial population in the mouth is compromised at the exact moment it matters most.

Wound healing slows across the board. The soft tissue: the gum around the implant: closes more slowly. The seal that forms between the gum and the implant surface is less robust. The incision takes longer to heal. Every tissue involved in recovery is operating at a disadvantage.

And over time, chronic smoking affects bone density itself. Smokers tend to have thinner, less dense bone in the jaw, which can affect both the initial placement and the long-term stability of the implant.

## The Numbers

The research on this is extensive and consistent. Implant failure rates in smokers are roughly double those in non-smokers.

Non-smokers: approximately 2-5% failure rate. That means for every hundred implants placed, two to five fail. The success rate sits around 95-98%.

Smokers: approximately 6-20% failure rate, depending on the study, the definition of "smoker" (there's a difference between five a day and twenty a day), and the follow-up period. The majority of implants in smokers still succeed: 80-94% is still a strong success rate. But the risk of failure is meaningfully, measurably higher.

The dose matters. Heavy smokers (twenty or more cigarettes a day) sit at the higher end of that failure range. Light smokers (under ten a day) sit closer to the lower end. The relationship is roughly linear: more cigarettes, more risk.

Location in the mouth matters too, and this is an interesting wrinkle. The upper jaw (maxilla) has softer, less dense bone than the lower jaw (mandible). Implants in the upper jaw fail more often than those in the lower jaw across all patients, but the difference is more pronounced in smokers. Softer bone combined with smoking-compromised healing compounds the risk.

## What the Quit Period Actually Does

Most implant clinics in the UK ask smokers to stop for two to four weeks before surgery and eight to twelve weeks after. This isn't an arbitrary rule or a morality exercise. The biology behind it is precise and measurable.

Within forty-eight hours of stopping smoking, carbon monoxide clears from the blood and the oxygen-carrying capacity of the red blood cells recovers. The tissues that were operating on reduced oxygen suddenly have access to a full supply. Within two weeks, circulation improves significantly: the constricted vessels relax, blood flow normalises, and the delivery of nutrients and immune cells to healing tissue ramps up. By four weeks, the acute effects on wound healing are substantially reduced.

The post-surgical quit period is even more important. The first twelve weeks after implant placement are when osseointegration is at its most active and vulnerable. The bone-forming cells are laying down new matrix. The immune system is managing the surgical site. The gum tissue is sealing around the implant. Every one of these processes benefits from the improved blood flow and immune function that stopping smoking provides.

The temporary sacrifice has a measurable return. Not in the abstract sense of "healthier," but in the concrete, quantifiable sense of "materially improved probability that this £1,999 investment succeeds."

## What Clinics Expect

Honesty. The implant surgeon needs accurate information about smoking habits to plan the treatment appropriately. The surgical protocol, healing timeline, and follow-up schedule may all be adjusted based on the smoking history. Understating the habit undermines the planning.

The quit period commitment. Two to four weeks before, eight to twelve weeks after. Some clinics are stricter; some are more flexible. The recommendation is consistent across the profession because the evidence is consistent.

Informed consent. The patient is told that the failure rate is higher, that [complications](/blog/dental-implant-complications-uk) are more likely, and that the healing period may be longer. This is informed consent in its most practical form: here are the adjusted probabilities, and you decide whether to proceed with full knowledge of what they mean.

The tone of these conversations is worth noting. It isn't judgemental. Implant surgeons have these discussions daily, and the clinical focus is entirely on optimising the outcome, not on lecturing about lifestyle. The question isn't "why do you smoke?" It's "here's how we get the best possible result given where we're starting from."

## E-Cigarettes and Vaping

The research is newer and less conclusive than the cigarette data, but the emerging picture makes biological sense. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine, and nicotine is the primary villain in the blood-flow story. Vessel constriction occurs regardless of whether the nicotine arrives via smoke, vapour, or patch.

The absence of tar and combustion products likely means vaping is less harmful to implant outcomes than traditional smoking. But it isn't harmless. The nicotine effect on blood flow persists. The healing compromise is real, if somewhat reduced. The same principles apply: quit period before and after surgery, honest disclosure, adjusted expectations.

## The Cost Angle

[Dental implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) start at [£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing). A failed implant doesn't just mean the tooth isn't replaced: it means the investment is lost. The failed implant needs removing. The bone needs time to heal (months). [Bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) may be needed to rebuild what was lost during the failure. A second implant attempt follows. The total cost of a failure-and-redo can approach double the original treatment.

For smokers, the financial argument for the quit period is the most pragmatic one: a few weeks of not smoking materially improves the odds that a significant financial investment succeeds. The temporary discomfort of quitting has a direct, measurable impact on the probability of keeping what you've paid for.

## The Alternatives

For smokers who can't or won't stop, the other tooth replacement options each have different relationships with smoking.

[Dental bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) rely on adjacent teeth for support, not bone integration. Smoking doesn't affect the mechanical anchoring of a bridge. It remains an effective replacement option regardless of smoking status.

[Dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk), whether [partial or full](/blog/partial-dentures-vs-full-dentures-cost), sit on the gum surface. Smoking affects gum tissue health and can increase denture-related irritation, but these are manageable complications rather than fundamental threats to the prosthesis.

And then there's the middle path: proceeding with implants, understanding the elevated risk, and accepting the adjusted odds. The majority of smokers' implants succeed. An 80-94% success rate is still a success rate that favours the patient. The decision to proceed is valid: it's just a decision made with open eyes.

## The Consultation

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the implant consultation for smokers includes examination, X-ray, and an honest discussion of bone quality, smoking history, and what the treatment plan looks like given the full picture. The conversation is practical: what the quit period involves, how the healing timeline adjusts, what the realistic expectations are.

[Dental implants from £1,999](/pricing). The assessment determines candidacy, maps out the timeline, and gives every patient, smoker or not, the clearest possible picture of what to expect.
