So here's something nobody tells you: you genuinely cannot smell your own breath.

Not because you're not paying attention. Not because you're in denial. Your nose literally filters it out. The bacteria doing their thing in your mouth sit so close to your smell receptors that your brain treats them like background noise, the same way you stop hearing the hum of your refrigerator after a few minutes in the kitchen.

Which means if you've ever wondered whether your breath is okay, you've probably done that thing where you breathe into your cupped hands and sniff. And it told you nothing useful whatsoever.

You're not alone in this, by the way. About one in four people in the UK deal with bad breath regularly. That's a lot of people walking around with the same quiet worry, doing the same cupped-hand test, getting the same inconclusive results.

## The Part That Might Actually Make You Feel Better

If you've been anxious about your breath, there's something reassuring buried in the science of it all.

Ninety percent of bad breath comes from the mouth itself. Not the stomach, despite what countless products have tried to convince us over the years. Not mysterious internal problems that would require mysterious internal solutions. Just the mouth. The oesophagus stays closed most of the time, which means stomach odours don't actually travel upward the way people imagine. The rare exceptions involve severe reflux where stomach contents regularly reach the throat, but that's a specific condition with other obvious symptoms, not an explanation for everyday breath concerns.

So for the vast majority of people wondering about their breath, the answer lives somewhere between their lips and the back of their tongue. And mouths are fixable. Mouths are what dentists and hygienists spend their entire working lives sorting out.

The culprit is usually bacteria. Your tongue's surface is covered in tiny grooves and papillae, and anaerobic bacteria love setting up home in those little crevices where oxygen doesn't reach easily. They feed on food particles and dead cells, and they produce sulphur compounds as metabolic byproducts. Hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan, compounds that smell like eggs left out too long. The bacteria aren't doing anything wrong from their perspective. They're just quietly going about their business, producing waste that happens to smell awful to human noses.

Your gumline is the other place these bacteria congregate, particularly in the small gaps between teeth and gums where brushing doesn't fully reach. When tartar builds up, it creates a kind of protective shelter for bacterial colonies. They settle in underneath, multiply, and keep producing those sulphur compounds day after day.

The reason this is good news is that those bacteria can be evicted. A professional clean reaches the places your toothbrush can't, disrupts the colonies, removes the tartar they've been sheltering under. The improvement is often immediate, noticeable before you've even left the practice. For a lot of people, that's genuinely all it takes.

## What It Actually Costs to Sort This Out

A standard hygienist appointment, the kind where they scale away the built-up tartar and polish everything smooth, runs somewhere between £75 and £100 at most private practices. At UrgentCare Dental, it's [£100 for a professional clean](/pricing). That appointment takes maybe half an hour, and people often notice a difference immediately, that clean-mouth feeling that lasts.

If there's more going on, say you've got [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) that's created deeper pockets where bacteria are really thriving, then a deep clean might be needed. That starts around £150 to £200 and involves getting below the gumline to clear out the bacterial colonies that have established themselves in those harder-to-reach spots.

There's also something called AirFlow cleaning, which uses a jet of air and fine powder to blast away the biofilm that regular scaling sometimes misses. It's particularly good for stubborn cases where someone's been doing everything right at home but still noticing problems. That runs £100 to £150 typically.

For genuinely persistent cases, specialised breath clinics exist that can measure exactly what's going on and identify which bacterial species are involved. Those consultations run £200 to £500 or more, but honestly, most people never need to go that far. A good hygienist appointment handles it.

## The Gum Connection

There's a thing that happens with gum disease that's worth knowing about.

When gums start pulling away from teeth, they create little pockets. And those pockets become perfect homes for the exact bacteria that produce the worst-smelling compounds. It's a sealed, oxygen-free environment down there, which these particular bacteria love. They set up shop, they multiply, they produce sulphur, and no amount of brushing from above can reach them.

This is why people sometimes feel like they're doing everything right and still have a problem. They are doing everything right. It's just that the problem has moved somewhere their toothbrush can't follow.

The encouraging part is that once a hygienist clears out those pockets, the improvement can be dramatic. Like, same-day dramatic. The source of the smell is physically removed.

## Between Appointments

Professional cleaning gives you a fresh start. What you do between appointments determines whether the problem creeps back.

Your tongue matters more than you might think. The back of it especially, where bacteria accumulate in all those tiny grooves. A tongue scraper takes about thirty seconds and removes a surprising amount of the coating where odour-causing bacteria live. Some people find this makes more difference than anything else they've tried.

The spaces between your teeth matter too. That's where food particles hang around and bacteria throw their little parties. Floss, interdental brushes, water flossers, whatever works for you and you'll actually use consistently.

And water. Just drinking enough water. Your saliva naturally washes bacteria away throughout the day, but when you're dehydrated, that flow slows down and bacteria get more comfortable. There's a reason morning breath is a thing: your saliva production drops while you sleep.

## If You've Been Worrying About This

There's something isolating about worrying whether your breath is okay. It's not like you can easily ask someone. And the uncertainty itself becomes its own kind of stress, that background hum of wondering whether people are subtly stepping back when you talk to them.

If that's been sitting with you, a [dental check-up](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk) is a straightforward way to get some answers. The dentist can tell you what's actually happening and what would help. At UrgentCare Dental, that initial conversation is just [£20](/pricing).

Most of the time, it's simpler than people fear. A cleaning, some tweaks to the home routine, maybe attention to the tongue. The worry tends to be worse than the fix.

And genuinely, dentists talk about breath all the time. It's just another thing they help people with, no different from sensitivity or bleeding gums. You won't be the first person to bring it up, and you definitely won't be the last.
