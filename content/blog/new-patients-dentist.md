Maybe it's been a while since you've seen a dentist. Maybe it's been a really long while, and there's a small knot in your stomach just thinking about it. Maybe you've just moved to the area, or your old practice closed, or you've simply never found somewhere that felt right.

Whatever brought you here, we're glad you're considering us.

Here's the thing about finding a new dentist: it's not just about finding someone who can look at your teeth. It's about finding somewhere you actually feel comfortable going back to. Somewhere that doesn't make you feel judged for the gaps in your dental history. Somewhere that tells you what things cost before they do them, not after.

That's what we've tried to build at UrgentCare Dental. And this is what it actually looks like when you come to see us for the first time.

## Booking Your First Appointment

There's no referral needed. No waiting list to join. No complicated registration process.

You can book online, call us, or message us on WhatsApp. We're open seven days a week at both our [Leeds](/blog/emergency-dentists-leeds) and [Manchester](/blog/emergency-dentist-manchester-prices) locations, which means finding a time that works around your life is usually pretty straightforward.

When you book, we'll ask a few basics: your name, contact details, and a rough idea of what you're coming in for. That's it. If you're nervous, you can mention that too, and we'll make a note so everyone knows to take a little extra care with you.

You don't need to bring anything fancy to your first visit. If you have details of any medications you're taking, that's helpful. If you've got old dental records or X-rays from a previous dentist, you're welcome to bring those, but it's absolutely not essential. We can see what we need to see.

## What Happens When You Arrive

The clinic is designed to feel calm. That might sound like marketing speak, but we genuinely thought about it. The waiting area isn't clinical and cold. There's no smell of that antiseptic that makes your brain immediately tense up.

When you arrive, someone at reception will greet you and ask you to fill in a short medical history form. This covers things like any conditions you have, medications you're on, and whether you've had any reactions to anaesthetic in the past. It takes about five minutes, and it helps us keep you safe.

If you're running a bit late, just let us know. Life happens. We'd rather you arrive flustered than not arrive at all.

## Your First Consultation

Your first appointment is a consultation. It's a chance for us to understand what's going on with your teeth and gums, and a chance for you to ask questions and tell us what you're hoping for.

The consultation costs £20. That's it. And if you need treatment, the consultation fee comes off the cost of that treatment, so you're not paying twice.

During the consultation, the dentist will have a thorough look around your mouth. They're checking your teeth for decay, your gums for signs of disease, and your whole mouth for anything that looks unusual. It's gentle, it's careful, and they'll talk you through what they're seeing as they go.

If you haven't been to a dentist in a long time, this is not the part where anyone lectures you. We've seen everything. Truly. Whatever state your teeth are in, we've seen worse, and we're not here to make you feel bad about it. We're here to help you work out what to do next.

## X-Rays and Diagnostics

Sometimes we need to see what's happening beneath the surface. That's where X-rays come in.

At UrgentCare Dental, [digital X-rays](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk) are included free with your consultation. You don't pay extra for them. We use them when they're clinically useful, not as a way to add charges to your bill.

Digital X-rays use far less radiation than the old film-based kind, and the images appear instantly on screen. The dentist can show you exactly what they're looking at, point out any areas of concern, and explain what the options are.

If we need more detailed imaging, like a CBCT scan for complex cases or implant planning, that does have a separate cost of £199. But for a standard new patient consultation, X-rays are included.

## Understanding What You Need

Once the dentist has had a good look, they'll sit down with you and explain what they've found. This is the part where we're genuinely different from a lot of practices.

We tell you everything. Not in a scary way, but in a "here's the full picture" way. If there are things that need attention now, we'll explain why. If there are things that we should keep an eye on but aren't urgent, we'll tell you that too. If your teeth are in great shape and you just need a clean, we'll happily tell you that.

And we tell you what things cost before you decide anything. Not ballpark figures, not "it depends." Actual prices. Written down if you want them.

Here's what some common treatments cost at UrgentCare Dental, so you have an idea:

A [standard cleaning](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk) costs £100. If you need a deeper clean because of gum disease, that's £150-180 depending on how extensive it is.

[Fillings](/blog/white-filling-costs-uk) range from £99 to £250 depending on size and complexity. We use tooth-coloured composite fillings as standard, not the old silver amalgam kind.

If you need a [tooth extracted](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk), simple extractions start at £149. Surgical extractions for teeth that are more difficult to access cost up to £549. [Wisdom teeth](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) are £549 per tooth.

[Root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) varies depending on which tooth it is, because molars with multiple roots take longer than front teeth. We'll give you an exact price once we can see what's involved.

[Crowns](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) are £650 each. [Bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) are £595 per unit.

The point is, you'll never be surprised by a bill. That's not how we work.

## If You're Nervous

A lot of people are nervous about the dentist. A lot. It's one of the most common fears there is, and there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

If you're nervous, tell us. Tell us when you book, tell us when you arrive, tell us when you're in the chair. We'd rather know than not know.

For some people, just knowing what's going to happen is enough to take the edge off. That's partly why we're so transparent about everything. No surprises means less anxiety.

For others, we offer [sedation options](/blog/dental-sedation-costs-uk) that can help. IV sedation costs £399 per session and puts you in a deeply relaxed state where you're conscious but calm. Many people don't remember much of the appointment afterward. If you need an extraction with sedation, that's £695 combined.

We also simply go slowly when we need to. If you need to take breaks, we take breaks. If you need the dentist to explain everything before they do it, they will. There's no rushing, no impatience, no making you feel like a nuisance for being scared.

## What Happens Next

At the end of your consultation, you'll have a clear picture of where things stand and what your options are. If you need treatment, we can often start the same day if you want to, or you can go away and think about it. There's no pressure.

If you decide to go ahead with treatment, we'll book you in for whatever's needed. Simple things like fillings or extractions can often be done within days. More complex treatments like [implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) or [orthodontics](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) involve a bit more planning.

For ongoing care, many of our patients join one of our dental plans, which spread the cost of routine checkups and cleanings across monthly payments. It works out more affordable than paying each time, and it means you're never putting off a checkup because of cost.

## Emergency Appointments

One more thing worth mentioning: if you come to us as a new patient because you're actually in pain right now, we treat that as an [emergency appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk).

Emergency appointments are £20, same as a standard consultation. We keep slots available every day specifically for people who need to be seen urgently. If you're dealing with a [dental abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency-treatment), a [broken tooth](/blog/broken-tooth-emergency-repair-cost), a [lost filling](/blog/loose-crown-emergency-fix), or just pain that won't go away, you don't have to wait.

We'll see you, work out what's wrong, and get you out of pain. Then, once you're comfortable, we can talk about the longer-term picture.

## Finding Us

Our Leeds clinic is at Whitehall Estate in Armley, open seven days a week. Our Manchester clinic offers the same services and the same pricing. Both locations have parking available, and we're set up to see new patients at short notice.

If you've been putting off finding a new dentist because you're not sure where to start, or because you're worried about what they'll find, or because the whole process just feels like too much, we get it. We really do.

But here's the truth: the longer you wait, the more complicated things tend to get. The small filling you need now becomes the [root canal](/blog/what-is-root-canal-treatment) you need later. The gum inflammation that's easy to treat today becomes the [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) that takes months to manage.

Coming in for a £20 consultation is genuinely one of the best things you can do for yourself. Even if it turns out everything's fine, you'll know. And if it turns out there's work to be done, at least you'll know exactly what you're dealing with and what it costs to sort it out.

We're here when you're ready.
