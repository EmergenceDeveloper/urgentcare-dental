Here's the good news: toothache is fixable. Whatever's causing that throbbing in your jaw right now, it can be sorted out, often in a single appointment. The pain you're feeling is your tooth telling you something needs attention, and once that something gets addressed, the pain goes away. Not masked, not managed. Gone.

At UrgentCare Dental, [emergency appointments](/blog/emergency-dentists-uk-info-costs-appointments) are £20. That gets you seen, gets the problem identified, and gets a plan in place. Follow-up care after treatment is free. For a lot of people searching "best thing for toothache" at midnight, that's the actual answer: knowing you can get this dealt with tomorrow without it costing a fortune.

But we know that doesn't help you right now, at whatever hour you're reading this, with your jaw throbbing and sleep feeling impossible. So let's talk about what actually helps with the pain in the meantime.

## What the Research Shows About Toothache Pain Relief

When it comes to over-the-counter pain relief for dental pain, the clinical research has some clear findings.

UK dental guidelines from the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) recommend ibuprofen as first-line treatment for dental pain because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Most toothache involves some degree of swelling or irritation in the tissue, and ibuprofen addresses that inflammation directly, while paracetamol works differently by blocking pain signals in the brain.

A Cochrane systematic review looking specifically at dental pain found that 400mg ibuprofen provided better pain relief than 1,000mg paracetamol. NHS guidance notes that both can be taken together for more effective relief, with the two working through different mechanisms to complement each other.

That said, ibuprofen isn't suitable for everyone. People with stomach ulcers, kidney issues, certain heart conditions, or those who are pregnant (especially in the third trimester) may need to stick with paracetamol alone. A pharmacist can help work out what's appropriate for individual circumstances.

One thing worth knowing: placing aspirin directly on the gum is an old folk remedy that actually causes chemical burns to the tissue. Pain medication works when swallowed, not when held against the tooth.

## A Few Home Remedies That Have Some Evidence Behind Them

Beyond what's available at the pharmacy, there are a few things you might already have at home that can help take the edge off.

A warm saltwater rinse is probably the most reliable. Salt acts as a natural disinfectant, and the warm water helps loosen any debris that might be trapped around the tooth. About half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in a glass of warm water, swished around the mouth for 30 seconds and then spat out, can reduce inflammation and provide some temporary relief. Dentists have been recommending this one for generations because it genuinely does something.

A cold compress held against the outside of the cheek (not directly on the tooth) helps reduce swelling and has a numbing effect. Ice wrapped in a cloth, applied for 15-20 minutes at a time, is a straightforward way to bring down inflammation. If you've ever used a bag of frozen peas on a sprained ankle, same principle here.

Clove oil appears in a lot of traditional toothache remedies, and there's a reason for that. It contains eugenol, which has a mild anaesthetic effect. A few drops on a cotton ball held against the affected area can provide temporary numbing. The taste is quite strong and medicinal, so it's not for everyone, but it's been used for dental pain for centuries.

Now, here's the thing about all of these approaches. They manage symptoms. They don't address what's actually causing the pain. Which brings us to something important.

## Why Toothache Doesn't Just Go Away on Its Own

It would be lovely if toothache worked like a headache, where you could ride it out and trust it would fade. Unfortunately, that's not usually how it goes.

Toothache happens when the nerve inside a tooth or the tissue surrounding it becomes irritated. This occurs for various reasons: decay that's reached the inner layers of the tooth, a crack that's exposing sensitive tissue, an infection forming at the root, gum disease affecting the supporting structures. What all these have in common is that they're progressive. They don't resolve themselves.

A cavity continues to deepen. An infection continues to spread. A crack continues to worsen with every bite. The pain might come and go, which can create the illusion that things are improving, but the underlying problem remains and typically compounds over time.

This is why pain relief, while genuinely helpful for getting through the night, isn't really the answer to "what's the best thing for toothache." The best thing is finding out what's wrong and fixing it. Pain medication buys time; treatment actually solves the problem.

And the sooner that happens, the simpler the fix tends to be. Which is worth knowing, because it's easy to put off making that call.

## When Toothache Needs Faster Attention

Most toothaches, unpleasant as they are, can wait until a convenient appointment time. But some situations do need faster attention, and it's worth knowing what to look out for.

Signs that suggest something more serious include facial swelling (particularly if the cheek or jaw is visibly puffy), fever alongside tooth pain, difficulty swallowing, or pain that doesn't respond at all to over-the-counter medication. These can indicate infection that's spreading beyond the tooth itself.

A dental abscess, which is essentially a pocket of infection, can develop when decay or damage allows bacteria into the inner tooth or the surrounding tissue. Left too long, the infection can spread to other parts of the body. Facial swelling combined with fever is the classic warning sign that an abscess needs prompt treatment.

A knocked-out tooth is also time-sensitive, but for different reasons. If the tooth can be reimplanted within an hour or so, there's a good chance of saving it. Keeping it moist (in milk if nothing else is available) and getting to a dentist quickly gives the best odds.

For pain that's unpleasant but manageable, that responds to pain relief, and that isn't accompanied by swelling or fever, booking an appointment in the next day or two is usually fine. The key is actually booking it rather than hoping things improve on their own.

## Getting to the Actual Fix

Everything else in this article is really about making toothache more bearable while you wait for the real fix. And that real fix is straightforward: finding out what's causing the pain and treating it.

A [dental examination](/pricing) identifies whether the issue is decay, infection, a crack, gum disease, or something else. Once that's clear, treatment can happen. Sometimes it's a filling. Sometimes it's a [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk). Sometimes it's an [extraction](/blog/emergency-tooth-extraction-costs-uk). Whatever it turns out to be, dealing with it means the toothache actually stops, rather than being temporarily dulled only to return.

The longer treatment gets delayed, the more complicated things tend to become. A small cavity caught early is a quick, straightforward fix. That same cavity left for months might mean the tooth can't be saved at all. Early intervention almost always means simpler treatment and better outcomes.

At UrgentCare Dental, we're set up specifically for situations like this. The [£20 emergency appointment](/blog/emergency-dentist-leeds-costs) exists because we know toothache doesn't wait for convenient moments, and neither should the solution. Our clinics in Leeds and Manchester see people every day who woke up in pain and want it sorted. That's what we're here for.

Your tooth is trying to tell you something. The best thing for toothache is listening to it.
