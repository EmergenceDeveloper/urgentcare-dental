Over half the adults in the UK are afraid of the dentist. Not a bit nervous. Afraid. That's more than 25 million people who get that tight feeling in their chest just thinking about a dental chair.

If you're one of them, you already know. You know the way your body tenses up when someone mentions a check-up. You know about the cancelled appointments and the years that slip by. You know about lying awake the night before, running through scenarios, bargaining with yourself about whether you really need to go.

You're not being dramatic. And you're not alone. Not even close.

Here's the thing that changes everything for people in this situation: IV sedation exists, and it's nothing like what you're imagining.

## What Actually Happens

Let's walk through it, because the unknown is half the fear.

You arrive at the practice. You sit in the chair. A small cannula goes into the back of your hand or your arm, the same kind of thing they'd use to take blood. If needles bother you, here's the good news: this is the only part you need to get through, and it takes about ten seconds.

The dentist starts the sedation medication through the cannula. Midazolam is the most common drug used in the UK. And this is where things get interesting.

Within about 30 seconds, a wave of calm washes over you. Not drowsiness, not unconsciousness. Calm. Deep, genuine, warm calm. The kind of relaxed you feel on the best holiday you've ever had, lying in the sun with absolutely nothing to worry about. That knot in your stomach dissolves. The tension in your jaw releases. The room is still there, the dentist is still there, you're still there. But none of it bothers you anymore. Not even slightly.

You can hear the dentist talking to you. You can respond. If they ask you to open wider, you do. But there's this wonderful disconnect between what's happening and how you feel about it. It's as if the part of your brain that generates anxiety has simply been switched off for a while.

And then, quite suddenly, you're being told it's all done.

## The Part That Surprises Everyone

Here's where it gets genuinely fascinating. Midazolam doesn't just relax you. It creates what's called anterograde amnesia. That's a clinical way of saying: you won't remember any of it.

Not vaguely. Not like "it's a bit fuzzy." For most people, the memory simply doesn't form. You go from feeling that wave of calm to being gently told the procedure is finished, and everything in between is just... gone. A gap. A pleasant gap that you'll never be able to fill, because the memories were never created in the first place.

For someone who's spent years dreading dental work, think about what that means. The thing you're terrified of genuinely ceases to exist as an experience. It happens, your teeth get fixed, and as far as your memory is concerned, you went from sitting down to being told everything's finished. That's it.

People describe it differently. Some say it felt like blinking. Some say it felt like a five-minute nap that turned out to be two hours. The common thread is this quiet amazement afterwards: "Was that really it? Did that actually happen?"

It did. And your teeth are fixed. And you don't remember a thing.

## You're Awake the Whole Time

This is worth being clear about, because a lot of people assume IV sedation means being "put to sleep." It doesn't.

You're conscious throughout. You can breathe on your own, swallow on your own, respond to instructions. You're in a deeply relaxed twilight state, aware enough to cooperate but detached enough that nothing registers as stressful. The technical term is "conscious sedation," and it's one of the safest forms of sedation in medicine.

General anaesthetic, where you're fully unconscious, is a completely different thing. That requires a hospital setting, an anaesthetist, and significantly more cost and risk. IV sedation happens in a normal dental chair with a trained dentist, and the safety profile is excellent.

The difference matters, because general anaesthetic is what most people picture when they think "being put to sleep." IV sedation is gentler, safer, and far more accessible. And for dental work, it achieves the same thing from your perspective: the experience effectively vanishes.

## What Happens Afterwards

The sedation wears off gradually. When the procedure finishes, you'll feel pleasantly groggy, a bit like waking up from a really deep afternoon nap. You'll need someone with you to take you home, because you won't be safe to drive for 24 hours. That's the midazolam still clearing your system, and it's the one non-negotiable requirement.

Most people feel back to normal by the evening. Some feel a bit floaty for the rest of the day. A few report sleeping brilliantly that night, which is a nice bonus.

There's no nausea, no hangover feeling, no unpleasant comedown. You just gradually return to normal, carrying with you the quiet satisfaction that something you've been dreading for months or years is now done. And you can't even remember it.

## The Cost of Not Feeling Terrified

IV sedation at a private dentist in the UK runs £350-£500 per session. At [UrgentCare Dental](/blog/dental-sedation-costs-uk), it's £399. That's the sedation fee on top of whatever treatment you're having done.

For context, here's how that sits alongside other sedation options:

Inhalation sedation (happy gas) costs £75-£150 per session. It's milder, taking the edge off rather than removing the anxiety entirely. You breathe a mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen through a small nose mask, feel pleasantly relaxed, and it wears off within minutes of removing the mask. For mild nerves, it works well. For genuine phobia, it's often not enough.

Oral sedation costs £75-£200. You take a tablet (usually diazepam) an hour before the appointment. It calms things down significantly, but you're more aware than with IV sedation, and the memory tends to stay intact. For moderate anxiety, it's a solid middle ground.

IV sedation costs more because it does more. The depth of relaxation is in a different league, and the amnesia effect is the key differentiator. For people who've been avoiding the dentist for years because of [genuine fear](/blog/dental-phobia-help-uk), it's the option that actually gets them into the chair and through the treatment.

## Years of Work in a Single Visit

Something that makes IV sedation particularly brilliant: it allows the dentist to do more work in one sitting.

When you're deeply relaxed and your gag reflex is suppressed, procedures that would normally take multiple visits can be combined. A patient who needs three fillings, a clean, and an extraction might get all of it done in a single two-hour session under sedation, instead of five separate anxiety-filled appointments over several months.

For someone with [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options) who's been putting things off and has a backlog of work needed, this is transformative. One appointment. One experience you won't remember. And when it's done, you're caught up. You're back to a place where routine check-ups are all you need.

## The Thing Nobody Talks About

There's a moment that happens after IV sedation that deserves more attention than it gets.

It's later that day, or maybe the next morning. The grogginess has worn off. You run your tongue across your teeth and feel the new fillings, or the smooth edge where a broken tooth used to be. And something shifts. You realise you actually did it. The thing you'd been putting off, the thing that felt impossible, the thing that kept you up at night. You did it.

And it was nothing.

That shift, that realisation, is quietly life-changing for a lot of people. The dentist stops being a place of dread and starts being a place where things get fixed. Future appointments feel different. The cycle of avoidance and worsening problems breaks.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), we see this happen constantly. Someone comes in who hasn't been to a dentist in five, ten, fifteen years. They're embarrassed, they're scared, they don't know what state things are in. They have IV sedation, the work gets done, and they walk out wondering why they waited so long. It's one of the most rewarding things in dentistry to be part of.

That moment when fear stops running the show? That's worth every penny of £399.
