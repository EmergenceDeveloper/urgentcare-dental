If you've been putting off dental work because the thought of it makes your stomach turn, you're in good company. Over half of UK adults feel some level of anxiety about the dentist, so you're not alone.

And when you finally start looking into sedation as a way to get through it, the first question is obvious (especially here in the UK): what's this actually going to cost me?

So, let's talk about sedation costs, and a surprising extraction + sedation bundle that cuts costs more than you might think.

## What We Offer at UrgentCare Dental

IV sedation at our Leeds clinic costs £399 per session. That's a flat rate, not an hourly charge that keeps ticking up if your procedure runs long.

If you're looking at having a tooth out and you know you want sedation for it, we offer an extraction with sedation bundle for £695. That covers both the sedation and the extraction itself, which works out considerably cheaper than paying for them separately.

For wisdom teeth specifically, the same principle applies. Wisdom tooth removal at UrgentCare Dental is £549 per tooth. Add IV sedation at £399, and you're looking at just under £950 for the complete package. Or if your wisdom tooth needs surgical extraction anyway, the £695 bundle route gets you there for less.

[Our full pricing](/pricing) is on the website, and consultations are £20. You come in, we take a look, we tell you exactly what needs doing and exactly what it'll cost. No surprises.

## What Is IV Sedation, Exactly?

You're not unconscious. That's the first thing people want to know.

IV sedation puts you in a deeply relaxed state where you're technically awake but you probably won't remember much afterwards. The medication goes in through a small needle in your arm or hand, it takes effect within minutes, and for most people the next thing they know is that everything's done and someone's offering them a cup of tea.

You'll need someone to take you home afterwards. You won't be driving, operating heavy machinery, or making any important decisions for the rest of the day. But you also won't be lying there acutely aware of every sound and sensation, which for a lot of people is the entire point.

The reason IV sedation costs what it does comes down to what's involved. It requires specific training to administer, monitoring equipment throughout the procedure, and recovery time afterwards where someone's keeping an eye on you. It's not just the medication itself.

## The Wider Picture: What Sedation Costs Across the UK

If you're comparing options or just want to understand what's out there, here's how sedation pricing typically breaks down.

**Nitrous oxide**, sometimes called laughing gas, is the lightest option. You breathe it in through a mask, it takes the edge off, and it wears off quickly enough that you can usually drive yourself home. Expect to pay somewhere between £50 and £100 per appointment at most practices.

**Oral sedation** means taking a pill before your appointment. It takes about an hour to kick in, you'll feel drowsy and relaxed, and you'll need someone to bring you home because the effects last several hours. Prices typically range from £75 to £250 depending on the practice.

**IV sedation** is the deepest form of conscious sedation. You're not under general anaesthetic, but you're as relaxed as you can be while still being technically awake. Most practices charge between £300 and £600, often on an hourly basis. Some London clinics charge £400 per hour or more.

The hourly charging model is worth understanding. If your procedure takes longer than expected, an hourly rate means your sedation costs keep climbing. A flat session rate like ours gives you more predictability.

## Tooth Extraction Under Sedation

This is one of the most common reasons people look into sedation in the first place. The extraction itself might be straightforward, but the thought of being awake for it is too much.

Across the UK, adding sedation to an extraction typically adds £200 to £400 on top of the extraction cost. So if you're looking at a surgical extraction that might cost £200 to £400 on its own, plus sedation at another £300 to £500, you could easily be looking at £700 or more before you've even factored in the consultation.

Our £695 extraction with sedation bundle exists because we know this is a common situation and we wanted to make the maths simpler.

## Wisdom Teeth and Sedation

Wisdom teeth are a particular case. They're at the back of your mouth, they're often impacted or at awkward angles, and removing them can involve cutting through gum tissue and sometimes bone. It's surgery, not just a quick pull.

For a lot of people, the thought of being awake and aware during that process is a complete non-starter. They'd rather not have it done at all than go through it conscious.

If that sounds familiar, sedation changes the equation entirely. You're there, technically, but you're not *there*. You wake up, it's done, you go home and sleep it off.

We've written more about [wisdom teeth removal costs](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) specifically if you want the full breakdown. The short version: wisdom tooth removal at UrgentCare Dental is £549 per tooth, and IV sedation is £399 per session. If you're having multiple wisdom teeth out in one go, one sedation session covers the lot.

## Is Sedation Worth the Cost?

This is really the question underneath all the pricing questions, isn't it?

For some people, sedation is a nice-to-have. They could get through the procedure without it, but they'd rather not, and they're happy to pay for the comfort.

For other people, sedation is the difference between getting dental work done and not getting it done at all. They've been putting off treatment for months or years because they couldn't face it. The [anxiety around dental visits](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options) isn't a minor inconvenience for them. It's a genuine barrier.

If you're in that second group, the cost of sedation isn't really a cost. It's an investment in actually being able to access the care you need. A tooth that gets treated now costs less than a tooth that gets left until it becomes an emergency. A filling is cheaper than a root canal. A root canal is cheaper than an extraction and an implant.

The maths tends to work out in favour of getting things dealt with sooner rather than later. Sedation just makes "sooner" possible for people who couldn't otherwise face it.
