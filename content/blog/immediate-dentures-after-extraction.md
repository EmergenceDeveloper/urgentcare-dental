The biggest fear about getting teeth extracted isn't the procedure itself. It's the gap. The idea of walking around without teeth, of eating without teeth, of smiling without teeth, of existing in the world with a visibly incomplete mouth. For people needing [multiple extractions](/blog/multiple-tooth-extractions), this fear can be paralysing enough to delay treatment for years.

Immediate dentures solve this problem completely. The teeth come out and the dentures go in, same appointment, same day. You walk into the practice with failing teeth and walk out with a full set of replacement teeth. At no point are you without teeth. Not for a day, not for an hour, not for a minute.

This is the thing that makes immediate dentures genuinely transformative for people who've been living with painful, decayed, or loose teeth and dreading the thought of being toothless during the transition. The transition has no gap.

## How It Works

The process starts weeks before the extraction appointment. The dentist takes impressions and measurements of the mouth while the teeth are still in place. These records are sent to a dental laboratory, where technicians fabricate the denture based on the existing mouth anatomy and the planned extraction pattern.

The clever part: the technician works from models of the mouth, removing the teeth from the plaster cast one by one and building the denture to fit the anticipated post-extraction anatomy. It's predictive manufacturing, creating a prosthesis for a mouth that doesn't exist yet, based on careful measurement and clinical experience.

On the day of the extractions, the teeth come out and the pre-made denture is placed directly into the mouth. The dentist checks the fit, makes adjustments, and ensures the bite is comfortable. The denture sits on the gum tissue immediately, providing aesthetics and some functional ability from the moment the teeth are removed.

The denture also serves a clinical purpose during the healing period. It acts as a bandage, applying gentle pressure to the extraction sites that helps control bleeding and protects the healing sockets. The gum tissue heals beneath the denture rather than being exposed to the open mouth.

## The Costs

Immediate dentures cost more than conventional dentures because the fabrication is more complex (predictive rather than direct) and the follow-up care is more intensive.

| Type | Cost Range |
| --- | --- |
| Immediate partial denture | £500-£1,200 |
| Immediate full denture (one arch) | £800-£2,000 |
| Immediate full dentures (both arches) | £1,500-£3,500 |
| Extraction costs (per tooth) | £100-£600 |
| Reline after healing (3-6 months) | £150-£400 |

These costs are in addition to the [extraction fees](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk). A full treatment plan for [multiple extractions](/blog/multiple-tooth-extractions) with immediate dentures might look like:

8 extractions at £150-£300 each: £1,200-£2,400
Immediate full denture: £800-£2,000
Reline at 6 months: £150-£400
Total: £2,150-£4,800

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the treatment plan covers the full cost breakdown before anything begins, so the financial picture is clear from the outset.

## The First Week

The immediate denture goes in on day one, and then real life with new dentures begins.

**Day one** is about adjustment. The mouth is numb from the extractions. The denture feels bulky and foreign. Speaking feels different: the tongue isn't sure where to go, and certain sounds (particularly "s" and "f") come out differently. Saliva production increases because the mouth interprets the denture as food and produces extra saliva to digest it. This settles within a few days.

Eating on day one is limited to [soft, cool foods](/blog/eating-after-tooth-extraction). The denture provides enough stability for yoghurt, smooth soup, and mashed potato. It's not designed for steak on day one; it's designed to let you eat, speak, and exist in the world without missing teeth while everything heals.

**Days 2-5** involve managing the extraction recovery and the denture adjustment simultaneously. The extraction sites are [healing](/blog/tooth-extraction-healing-timeline), which means swelling (peaking at 48 hours), soreness, and the restrictions that come with any extraction. The denture sits over these healing sites, which can feel uncomfortable: areas of pressure where the denture presses against swollen tissue.

The dentist typically schedules a follow-up within 24-48 hours to check the fit and relieve any pressure points. Small adjustments (grinding down areas of the denture that are pressing too hard) make a significant difference to comfort. Multiple adjustment appointments in the first two weeks are normal and expected.

**The speech adjustment** happens faster than most people expect. Within 3-5 days, the tongue and lips have adapted to the denture's presence, and speech sounds natural. Reading aloud (genuinely, this helps) accelerates the adaptation by training the muscles to work with the new palate and tooth positions.

## The Healing Period: Why Immediate Dentures Need Adjusting

Here's the part that makes immediate dentures different from conventional dentures, and the part that requires realistic expectations.

After teeth are extracted, the bone that held them begins resorbing. This is a normal biological process: the bone was maintained by the forces transmitted through the tooth roots, and without those forces, the body reclaims the bone. The ridge (the bony ridge where the teeth used to sit) shrinks.

This shrinkage is most dramatic in the first 3-6 months after extraction. The ridge can lose 30-50% of its width in the first year. The gum tissue changes shape as the underlying bone remodels.

The immediate denture was made to fit the mouth as it was on extraction day. As the ridge shrinks and the gum contours change, the denture's fit deteriorates. It becomes loose. It moves when eating or speaking. It may create sore spots where the base no longer conforms to the changed tissue.

This is expected and planned for. The treatment pathway for immediate dentures includes:

**Temporary relines** (soft reline material added to the denture's fitting surface) at 2-4 week intervals during the initial healing period. These adapt the denture to the changing contours and maintain a reasonable fit. Cost: often included in the immediate denture fee or £50-£100 per reline.

**A permanent reline** at 3-6 months, once the major ridge changes have stabilised. The denture is sent to the laboratory, where the fitting surface is rebuilt to match the healed ridge. This restores a precise fit that's been gradually lost during healing. Cost: £150-£400.

**A replacement denture** at 12-18 months is sometimes recommended. By this point, the ridge has changed enough that even a reline can't compensate. A new denture, made to fit the fully healed ridge, provides optimal fit and aesthetics. This new denture is a conventional denture (made from direct impressions of the healed mouth) and will last 5-10 years. Cost: £500-£1,500.

## Immediate Dentures vs Waiting

The alternative to immediate dentures is conventional dentures: extracting the teeth, waiting 3-6 months for the ridge to heal and stabilise, then making and fitting the denture. The advantage of this approach is that the denture is made for the final, stable ridge anatomy. The fit is optimal from the start, and fewer adjustments are needed.

The disadvantage is the gap. Three to six months without teeth, or with a visibly incomplete smile. For some people, this is acceptable, particularly if the remaining teeth are already few and the social impact is limited. For others, months without visible front teeth is simply not an option.

The immediate denture offers something that the conventional approach can't: continuity. Teeth come out, teeth go in, life continues. The price for that continuity is more adjustment appointments, at least one reline, and potentially a replacement denture after healing. Most people consider this a fair exchange.

## Immediate Dentures vs Implants

For patients who are ultimately planning [dental implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk), immediate dentures serve as an interim solution. The dentures provide teeth during the healing period, and once the bone has stabilised, implant placement can begin.

The [All-on-4](/blog/all-on-4-dental-implants-cost-uk) and [All-on-6](/blog/all-on-6-vs-all-on-4-dental-implants) approaches offer an alternative path: extracting teeth and placing implants with a temporary bridge in the same session. This eliminates the denture phase entirely, going from natural teeth to implant-supported teeth in one procedure. The cost is higher ([full-mouth implants start from £8,000-£15,000](/blog/full-mouth-dental-implants-cost-uk)), but the result is fixed teeth rather than removable ones.

For patients who want implants but can't afford them immediately, immediate dentures provide functional teeth now, with the option to transition to implants when finances allow. The denture doesn't prevent future implant placement; it simply provides teeth in the meantime.

## Living with Immediate Dentures

The adjustment to wearing dentures is a genuine transition, and setting realistic expectations makes it smoother.

**Eating** with new dentures requires adaptation. Start with soft foods and introduce firmer textures gradually over weeks. Cut food into small pieces. Chew on both sides simultaneously (this stabilises the denture better than chewing on one side). Hard, sticky, and very chewy foods are challenging with new dentures and become easier as the fit improves and the muscles adapt.

**Denture adhesive** may be helpful during the healing period when the fit is changing. A thin layer of adhesive paste or powder on the fitting surface provides additional grip while the denture is being adjusted. Once the permanent reline is done and the fit is optimal, adhesive may not be necessary.

**Cleaning** the denture is essential. Remove it nightly (once the dentist says it's okay; the first night or two, the denture may be left in to protect the extraction sites). Brush it with a soft brush and denture cleaner (not regular toothpaste, which is too abrasive). Soak it in denture-cleaning solution overnight. Clean the gums and any remaining teeth before reinserting.

**The emotional adjustment** is real and worth acknowledging. Even with immediate dentures providing a complete smile, the transition from natural teeth to prosthetic ones involves a period of adaptation: feeling different, eating differently, speaking differently. For people who delayed treatment for years because of this fear, the reality is almost always better than the anticipation.

## The Assessment

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the conversation about immediate dentures begins with the assessment: how many teeth need extracting, what's the condition of the remaining teeth, and what are the patient's priorities (aesthetics, function, budget, timeline).

The treatment plan covers every step: the impressions, the extractions, the denture fitting, the adjustment schedule, and the anticipated reline or replacement timeline. [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) is available for the extraction appointment ([£399](/pricing)), making the transition from old teeth to new teeth as comfortable as possible.

The fear of being toothless keeps people living with painful, failing teeth far longer than they need to. Immediate dentures eliminate that fear. Teeth come out, teeth go in, and the problem that's been affecting confidence, comfort, and quality of life for years is solved in a single afternoon.
