The dentist has just told you the tooth is in trouble. Serious trouble. And now there's a choice: save it with a [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), or take it out with an [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk).

Two completely different paths from the same starting point. One keeps the tooth. One removes it. And the interesting thing, the thing that surprises most people when they actually look at the numbers, is that extraction is only cheaper if you stop counting.

Because pulling a tooth is the beginning of a cost story, not the end of one.

## The Upfront Numbers

A [root canal costs £600-£1,400](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), depending on the tooth. Front teeth sit at the lower end (one canal, simpler procedure). Molars hit the upper end (three or four canals, 90 minutes to three hours of meticulous work). After the root canal, the tooth needs a [crown](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) to protect it: that's another £400-£650. Total investment: £1,000-£2,050.

An extraction costs £100-£300 for a [simple extraction](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction), or £200-£600 for a [surgical one](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction). At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), a [wisdom tooth extraction is £549](/pricing). The procedure itself costs a fraction of a root canal.

And here's where the maths shifts. An extraction leaves a gap. That gap has consequences.

## The Cost of the Gap

A missing tooth is more than cosmetic. The teeth on either side of the gap start drifting toward it. The tooth above (or below) the gap starts over-erupting because there's nothing to bite against anymore. The jawbone where the root used to be begins resorbing: losing density and volume because it's no longer stimulated by the forces of chewing.

These changes happen gradually, over months and years. They're not emergencies. They're slow-motion architecture problems, the dental equivalent of subsidence.

Filling the gap properly means one of three options:

A [dental implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) replaces the root with a titanium post and tops it with a crown. Cost: [£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), or £2,000-£3,000 across the UK. This is the closest thing to getting the original tooth back.

A [dental bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) spans the gap by crowning the teeth on either side and suspending a false tooth between them. Cost: £1,500-£3,000. The downside: two healthy neighbouring teeth get filed down to anchor the bridge.

A [partial denture](/blog/partial-dentures-vs-full-dentures-cost) is the most affordable option: a removable appliance that clips in and out. Cost: £300-£800. Functional, but it's a removable appliance rather than a fixed tooth.

So the full cost of extraction plus replacement: £400-£3,600, depending on the replacement chosen. And if no replacement is placed? The slow drift, the bone loss, the bite changes that create problems in teeth that were previously fine.

## The Pain Comparison

This is the question that drives the decision for a lot of people, and the answer runs against the popular narrative.

[Root canal treatment](/blog/what-is-root-canal-treatment) is performed under local anaesthetic. The tooth is completely numb. The sensation during the procedure is pressure, vibration, and the awareness that something is happening deep in the tooth. Pain? The anaesthetic prevents it entirely. The procedure itself is less eventful than the infection that prompted it.

The reputation root canals have for being painful comes from a time before modern anaesthesia. Decades ago, numbing a severely infected tooth was unreliable because the acidic environment of infection reduced the anaesthetic's effectiveness. Modern techniques and anaesthetics have solved this problem completely. A root canal in [YEAR] is no more uncomfortable than a filling.

Extraction under local anaesthetic involves pressure and a rocking sensation as the tooth is loosened and removed. [Simple extractions](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction) take 15-30 minutes. [Surgical extractions](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction) take 30-60 minutes. The procedure itself is painless under anaesthetic, the same as a root canal.

The difference shows up in recovery. After a root canal, the tooth is tender for 2-3 days. Over-the-counter painkillers handle it comfortably. Normal eating resumes within a day or two.

After an extraction, the [recovery](/blog/tooth-extraction-healing-timeline) is more involved: 3-5 days of [soft food](/blog/eating-after-tooth-extraction), swelling that peaks at 48 hours, and a healing socket that needs 1-2 weeks to close over. There's also a 2-5% risk of [dry socket](/blog/dry-socket-after-tooth-extraction), which produces intense pain on days 3-5.

Root canal recovery is milder. Extraction recovery is more disruptive.

## The Longevity Question

A root canal treated tooth, properly restored with a [crown](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk), lasts a median of [20 years](/blog/root-canal-longevity). That's from the largest study of its kind: 46,000 patients, 71,000 teeth. Twenty years of the tooth sitting in its socket, biting and chewing, doing exactly what a tooth does.

An extraction is permanent. The tooth is gone. The replacement's longevity depends on which replacement: dental [implants last 20-25 years](/blog/how-long-do-dental-implants-last) (and frequently longer), bridges last 10-15 years before needing replacement, and dentures need replacing every 5-10 years.

The root canal keeps the original tooth, with its original root, its original position in the jaw, its original relationship with the surrounding bone. No replacement, however good, perfectly replicates the integration of a natural tooth in living bone.

## When Root Canal Wins

Root canal is the better choice when the tooth can be saved. That sounds obvious, but the clinical criteria are specific.

The tooth has enough structure remaining to support a crown after treatment. The root isn't fractured vertically (a vertical root fracture is one of the few situations where a root canal can't save the tooth). The canals are accessible and the infection hasn't destroyed too much of the surrounding bone.

For most teeth meeting these criteria, root canal treatment is the recommended path. The tooth is preserved, the infection is eliminated, and the long-term costs are lower because no replacement is needed.

## When Extraction Wins

Extraction becomes the better option when the tooth is beyond saving or when saving it requires disproportionate investment.

**Extensive structural damage**: a tooth that's broken below the gum line, with insufficient structure to hold a crown, is better extracted than subjected to heroic (and expensive) attempts at restoration that may fail.

**Vertical root fracture**: a crack running lengthways down the root can't be repaired. The tooth will continue to be a source of infection regardless of root canal treatment. Extraction is the definitive solution.

**Wisdom teeth**: [wisdom tooth](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) problems are almost always resolved by extraction rather than root canal. Wisdom teeth sit so far back that root canal treatment is technically difficult, and these teeth aren't essential for chewing. The cost of root canal treatment on a wisdom tooth is rarely justified when extraction solves the problem permanently.

**Repeated root canal failure**: if a tooth has had a [previous root canal that's failed](/blog/root-canal-longevity), retreatment is possible but has lower success rates. At some point, the cost of further attempts exceeds the cost of extraction and replacement.

**Periodontal disease**: if the tooth has severe gum disease with significant bone loss around the roots, saving the nerve may not save the tooth. The root canal addresses the internal problem, but if the external support structure is compromised, the tooth's future is limited regardless.

## The Decision in Practice

The dentist assesses the tooth, reviews the X-ray, and makes a recommendation. The factors are clinical: how much tooth structure remains, whether the canals are accessible, what the surrounding bone looks like, whether the tooth is strategically important for the bite.

For most teeth in most situations, when the choice genuinely exists, root canal treatment is the recommendation. Keeping a natural tooth is almost always preferable to removing it and replacing it with something artificial. The initial cost is higher, but the long-term cost is lower, and the outcome is better.

The exception proves the rule. When a tooth genuinely can't be saved, or when saving it requires investment that exceeds the cost of extraction and a quality replacement, extraction is the pragmatic choice. There's no sentiment in the decision: it's about which option gives the best outcome for the lowest long-term cost.

## The Real Comparison

Root canal: £1,000-£2,050 (treatment plus crown). One recovery of 2-3 days. The tooth stays. No replacement needed. Twenty-year median lifespan with a crown.

Extraction: £100-£600 (the pull). Recovery of 5-10 days. Then £300-£3,000 for the replacement. Then maintenance and eventual replacement of the replacement.

The calculation is clearer than most dental decisions. Saving a tooth costs less than replacing it. The procedure is no more painful. The recovery is easier. The outcome lasts longer.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the assessment includes X-ray imaging that shows exactly what's happening with the tooth, the infection, the remaining structure, and the prognosis. The recommendation, root canal or extraction, is made on the clinical evidence. Both options are available, and both are performed with [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) for patients who prefer it (the [sedation fee is £399](/pricing), covering the entire session).

The choice between saving a tooth and pulling it feels dramatic. The numbers make it straightforward.
