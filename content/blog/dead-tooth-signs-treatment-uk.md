A tooth is alive. It has a blood supply, nerve fibres, connective tissue: a living core called the pulp, housed inside the hard mineral shell. The blood supply enters through tiny openings at the tip of each root and feeds the tooth from the inside. The nerve is what lets you feel temperature and pressure. The whole system is remarkably self-contained: a miniature organ, sitting in bone, doing its work for decades without asking for much.

When that blood supply is cut off or the pulp tissue dies, the tooth is dead. The mineral structure remains: it still looks like a tooth, still occupies its space in the arch, still has the same shape. But the living tissue inside is gone. And that changes everything about what happens next.

## How a Tooth Dies

### Trauma

A blow to the face, a fall, a sports collision, any impact that jars a tooth hard enough. The force damages the blood vessels that enter through the root tip. The vessels tear or rupture, the blood supply is interrupted, and the pulp tissue, deprived of oxygen and nutrients, dies.

This can happen immediately after the trauma or gradually over months and years. A tooth that was knocked hard during a rugby match at seventeen might look perfectly fine for a decade and then slowly begin to darken at twenty-eight. The damage was done years earlier; the pulp died slowly, and the discolouration is the visible evidence.

### Decay

Untreated [decay](/blog/white-filling-costs-uk) progresses through the enamel, through the dentine, and eventually reaches the pulp chamber. Bacteria from the cavity invade the pulp. The immune response tries to fight the infection in a confined space with no escape route, and the inflammation and infection kill the pulp tissue. An [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) forms at the root tip as the infection spills out of the tooth into the surrounding bone.

This is the most common pathway. A small cavity that could have been treated with a [filling](/blog/how-long-do-fillings-last) for £99 progresses untreated until it reaches the nerve, kills the tooth, and creates an infection that requires [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) at £600-£1,400.

### Previous Dental Work

Teeth that have had extensive treatment: large fillings, [crowns](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk), or repeated restorations over the years: carry a cumulative risk of pulp death. Each time a tooth is drilled, the pulp is traumatised by the vibration, heat, and proximity of the preparation. Most teeth tolerate this well. Some, particularly those with very deep fillings or a history of multiple restorations, eventually develop irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp that progresses to death).

A tooth with [pain after a filling](/blog/tooth-pain-after-filling) that doesn't resolve within a few weeks may be heading in this direction. The pulp was pushed beyond its tolerance, and the inflammation has passed the point of recovery.

## The Signs

### Darkening

The most visible sign. A dead tooth changes colour over time, shifting from its natural shade toward grey, yellow-brown, or dark grey. The discolouration comes from the breakdown products of the dead pulp tissue and the blood that was trapped inside the tooth when the vessels ruptured. These breakdown products permeate the dentine and darken the tooth from the inside out.

The colour change is gradual. It may take months or years to become noticeable. It often starts as a subtle difference from the adjacent teeth and progresses to an obvious discolouration. On a [front tooth](/blog/root-canal-front-tooth-uk), the change is immediately conspicuous. On a back tooth, it may go unnoticed for years.

### Pain (Sometimes)

A dying tooth can be painful: the inflammation of the pulp before it fully dies (pulpitis) produces a deep, throbbing, often severe [toothache](/blog/toothache-at-night) that responds poorly to painkillers. The pain may be sharp with hot or cold, lingering for minutes after the stimulus is removed. This is the tooth in the process of dying: the nerve is inflamed and sending distress signals.

Once the pulp is completely dead, the tooth may become pain-free. The nerve that was producing the pain no longer exists. This pain-free period can create a false reassurance: the agony has stopped, so the problem must have resolved. It hasn't. The dead tissue inside the tooth is now a breeding ground for bacteria, and an [abscess](/blog/tooth-abscess-burst-on-its-own) is forming at the root tip.

When the abscess builds enough pressure, pain returns: a different pain, deeper, duller, centred on the root tip rather than the tooth itself. The gum may [swell](/blog/swollen-face-toothache). The tooth may become tender to bite on. The infection has established itself.

### No Response to Temperature

A dead tooth doesn't react to cold or hot. The cold spray test (a standard diagnostic tool where the dentist applies a freezing cold cotton pellet to the tooth) produces no sensation on a dead tooth. Adjacent living teeth respond normally. The dead tooth: nothing. The nerve is gone.

This is one of the most reliable diagnostic tests. If a tooth that previously reacted to cold no longer responds, and the adjacent teeth do, the pulp has died.

## Treatment

### Root Canal Treatment

[Root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) removes the dead pulp tissue from inside the tooth, cleans and disinfects the canal system, and seals it with a filling material. The tooth remains in the mouth, still functioning, still occupying its position in the arch: but now without a living core.

**Cost: £600-£1,400**, depending on which tooth. Front teeth with a single canal are at the lower end. Back teeth with three or four canals are at the upper end.

After root canal treatment, the tooth typically needs a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) (£650). The combination of the dead pulp and the access cavity (the hole drilled through the top of the tooth to reach the canals) leaves the tooth structurally weakened. A crown restores the strength and protects against fracture.

For darkened front teeth, the crown also addresses the cosmetics: a porcelain crown in the correct shade covers the discolouration entirely. Internal bleaching (placing whitening agent inside the tooth after root canal treatment) is another option for moderate discolouration.

Root canal treatment has a high success rate: [around 90-95%](/blog/root-canal-longevity) for initial treatment. The tooth can function for decades after treatment, and many root-treated teeth last a lifetime.

### Extraction

If the tooth is too damaged to restore: extensive decay, a vertical root fracture, severe bone loss around the roots: [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk) removes the dead tooth entirely.

**Cost: £100-£600** for the extraction. The gap then needs addressing with a [dental implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) (from [£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing)), a [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), or a [denture](/blog/partial-dentures-vs-full-dentures-cost).

The decision between root canal and extraction depends on how much viable tooth structure remains and the long-term prognosis. A tooth with good structure and adequate bone support is worth saving with root canal treatment. A tooth that's extensively damaged or has a poor long-term outlook is better extracted and replaced.

## Leaving It Untreated

A dead tooth left untreated doesn't just sit there quietly. The dead tissue inside the tooth becomes infected. Bacteria colonise the pulp chamber and root canals. The infection escapes through the root tip into the bone. An abscess develops.

The abscess may be chronic (a slow, ongoing infection that periodically [drains through a gum boil](/blog/tooth-abscess-burst-on-its-own), causing bad taste but minimal pain) or acute (a sudden, painful [swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache) that demands [emergency treatment](/blog/same-day-emergency-dental-appointments)).

Either way, the [infection is active](/blog/tooth-infection-spreading-signs), the bone around the root tip is being destroyed, and the longer it continues, the more bone is lost. Bone loss at the root tip can eventually compromise the viability of [future implant placement](/blog/dental-bone-loss-treatment-uk) if the tooth ultimately needs extraction.

A darkened, dead tooth won't get better on its own. The discolouration will only deepen. The infection will only progress. The bone destruction will only continue.

## The Assessment

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), a dead tooth assessment includes the cold test (checking if the tooth responds to temperature), an X-ray (showing any abscess at the root tip and assessing the tooth's structure and bone support), and a clinical examination. The assessment determines whether root canal treatment can save the tooth and what the full treatment plan looks like.

[Emergency appointments are £20](/pricing) for patients with active symptoms: pain, swelling, or a tooth that's recently darkened. The assessment moves directly into treatment planning, and [same-day treatment](/blog/same-day-emergency-dental-appointments) is available for urgent cases.

A dead tooth is a treatable problem. The tooth can be saved, the infection resolved, and the cosmetics restored. The starting point is the assessment that tells you exactly where things stand.
