Here's something that surprises most people: a root canal, this procedure that's become a cultural shorthand for unbearable experiences, takes about as long as watching an episode of television. Sometimes less. The reputation is wildly disproportionate to the reality, and one of the biggest sources of anxiety is simply not knowing how long you'll be in the chair.

So let's answer that directly, and then unpack why the time varies as much as it does, because the reason turns out to be genuinely fascinating.

## The Short Answer

**Front teeth (incisors, canines): 30-60 minutes.** One appointment.

**Premolars: 45-75 minutes.** One appointment.

**Molars: 60-90 minutes.** Sometimes two appointments for complex cases.

That's it. That's the range. The vast majority of root canals are started and completed within a single appointment, and the total chair time, including the anaesthetic taking effect, includes the entire experience from sitting down to walking out.

## Why Front Teeth Are Fastest

This is where it gets interesting. The reason a front tooth root canal takes half the time of a molar root canal has nothing to do with skill or technique. It's anatomy. Pure, elegant anatomy.

A front tooth has one root. Inside that root is one canal: a single tube running from the crown down to the root tip. One channel to locate, one channel to clean, one channel to fill. The dentist creates an access hole through the back of the tooth, finds the canal opening, works down its length with a series of increasingly fine instruments, flushes it with disinfectant, dries it, and fills it with a rubber-like sealing material. The whole procedure follows a single, straight path.

The canal in a front tooth is typically wider and more accessible than those in back teeth. The instruments move through it without the same complexity of navigation. It's a clean, efficient procedure.

## Why Molars Take Longer

A molar has two or three roots. Each root contains at least one canal, sometimes two. A lower molar typically has three canals. An upper molar typically has three or four. Some molars have five. The dentist has to find, clean, shape, and fill every single one.

And here's the part that makes molar root canals genuinely remarkable: the canals aren't uniform. They branch, they curve, they narrow. Some divide partway down into two separate channels. Some have tiny side branches (lateral canals) that connect to the main canal like tributaries feeding a river. The internal geography of a molar root system is a miniature landscape, and the dentist navigates every passage.

Each additional canal adds time. Finding the canal openings in the floor of the pulp chamber: time. Negotiating each canal with instruments that are sometimes thinner than a human hair: time. Flushing each canal with irrigating solution to dissolve tissue and kill bacteria: time. Drying each canal and filling it precisely to the tip: time. Multiply that by three, four, or five canals, and the 60-90 minute appointment makes complete sense.

The anatomy also explains why some molar root canals need two appointments. If there's a severe [infection](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) or an [abscess](/blog/tooth-abscess-burst-on-its-own) at the root tip, the dentist may clean and medicate the canals at the first visit, place a temporary dressing, and complete the filling at a second visit a week or two later. The medication (typically calcium hydroxide) sits inside the canals between appointments, disinfecting the canal system before the permanent seal is placed. Two shorter appointments rather than one marathon session.

## What's Actually Happening During the Procedure

The clock starts with anaesthetic. [Local anaesthetic numbs the tooth](/blog/does-root-canal-hurt) and surrounding area: 2-5 minutes for injection, then 5-10 minutes for it to take full effect. The tooth needs to be completely numb before anything begins. No rushing this step.

A rubber dam is placed: a thin sheet of rubber that isolates the tooth, keeping the treatment area dry and preventing debris or irrigating solution from entering the mouth. This is a small detail that makes a significant difference to the quality and safety of the treatment.

The access cavity is drilled through the top of the tooth: a small hole that opens the pathway to the pulp chamber and canal openings. Under the drill, the pulp chamber appears: a small space inside the crown of the tooth where the canals originate. In a healthy tooth, this chamber contains the living pulp. In a tooth needing [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), it contains dead or dying tissue, bacteria, and sometimes pus.

The canal openings are located in the floor of the pulp chamber. They're small: sometimes less than a millimetre across. The dentist uses magnification (loupes or a microscope), a good light source, and tactile feel to find every opening. Missing a canal is one of the main causes of [root canal failure](/blog/failed-root-canal-retreatment-uk), so this step is meticulous.

Each canal is measured electronically. A tiny instrument is inserted into the canal, and an electronic apex locator determines the length: exactly how far the canal extends to the root tip. Getting this measurement precise is essential: the filling must extend to the tip but not beyond it.

The canals are shaped and cleaned with rotating nickel-titanium instruments that flex with the canal's curvature. The instruments gradually enlarge the canal, creating a tapered shape that allows thorough flushing with irrigating solution (usually sodium hypochlorite, which dissolves organic tissue and kills bacteria). This is the most time-consuming part: careful, methodical enlargement and flushing of each canal.

When all canals are clean, dry, and shaped, they're filled with gutta-percha (a natural rubber-like material) and a sealer cement. The filling is compacted into the canal to create an airtight seal from the root tip to the pulp chamber. The access cavity is then sealed with a filling.

## Afterward

The tooth is numb for 2-4 hours after the appointment. There's typically some soreness for a few days: a tender, bruised feeling, not the acute pain that brought the patient in. Over-the-counter painkillers manage it comfortably.

Most root-canalled teeth need a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) (£650 at [UrgentCare Dental](/pricing)). The crown protects the structurally weakened tooth from fracture. Back teeth almost always need a crown. Front teeth sometimes manage with a filling in the access cavity, though a crown is often recommended for long-term reliability.

The crown appointment is separate: usually 2-3 weeks after the root canal, once the tooth has settled. Two more appointments (preparation and fitting) of about 30-45 minutes each.

## What Affects the Duration

Beyond the tooth type, several factors influence how long a specific root canal takes:

**Calcified canals.** In older teeth or teeth that have been traumatised, the canals can narrow significantly or become blocked with secondary dentine. Finding and navigating these narrowed canals takes patience and time. A calcified molar can turn a 75-minute procedure into a 120-minute procedure.

**Curved roots.** Roots that curve sharply require more careful instrumentation. Each instrument pass follows the curve, and working around tight bends takes more time than working through straight canals.

**Active infection.** A tooth with a large [abscess](/blog/tooth-abscess-burst-on-its-own) or [spreading infection](/blog/tooth-infection-spreading-signs) may need additional irrigation time. The canal system needs to be as clean as possible, and a heavily infected tooth simply needs more flushing.

**Retreatment.** A [previously root-canalled tooth](/blog/failed-root-canal-retreatment-uk) that needs retreatment takes longer than a first-time root canal. The old filling material must be removed from every canal before the canals can be re-cleaned and refilled. This adds 30-60 minutes to the procedure.

**Patient comfort.** Some patients need more breaks, more reassurance, or a slower pace. The treatment adapts to the patient, not the other way around. [Sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) (£399 at [UrgentCare Dental](/pricing)) is available for patients who need it, though the procedure time under sedation is the same: the patient is simply more comfortable during it.

## The Appointment

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [root canal process](/blog/dental-implant-procedure-step-by-step) begins with an assessment that includes X-ray and examination. The X-ray shows the number and shape of the roots, any infection at the root tips, and the complexity of the canal system. This assessment determines whether the root canal will be straightforward or complex, single-appointment or two-appointment, and gives a realistic time estimate before the procedure begins.
