The root canal was done months ago. Maybe years ago. The tooth was fixed, the pain stopped, the crown went on, and the whole episode faded into one of those dental memories you file away and prefer not to revisit.

And now something's happening again. A dull ache in that same tooth. Tenderness when you bite down. A small bump on the gum above the root, like a blister that comes and goes. The kind of symptoms that make you think: surely not. That tooth was treated. It's supposed to be fine.

Root canals have excellent success rates. Around 85-95% of treated teeth heal completely and remain problem-free for [decades](/blog/root-canal-longevity). But that 5-15% represents a real number of teeth where the treatment didn't fully resolve the problem, and knowing what happens next turns an anxious mystery into a manageable situation.

## Why Root Canals Fail

The word "failure" is misleading because it implies something went wrong during the original treatment. Sometimes it did. More often, the failure has less to do with the quality of the original work and more to do with the anatomy of the tooth.

**Missed canals** are the most common reason. Teeth have a reputation for hiding their internal architecture. A molar that appeared to have three canals might have had a fourth, tucked behind one of the others, too narrow to detect on the original X-ray. That unfound canal harbours bacteria, and over time, the bacteria repopulate and produce a new infection. Modern CT imaging finds these hidden canals with far greater reliability than conventional X-rays, which is why retreatment often succeeds where the original treatment didn't.

**Incomplete cleaning** of canals that were found but not fully navigated leaves bacteria in the deepest reaches of the root. Canals can curve, branch, and narrow to dimensions thinner than a human hair. If the instruments didn't reach the full length of a canal, bacteria survive in the untreated portion.

**Coronal leakage** is the most preventable cause of failure. If the tooth's [crown](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) or filling develops a gap or crack, bacteria from the mouth can re-enter the canal system through that gap. The root canal itself may have been perfect, but the seal on top failed. This is why getting a quality crown after root canal treatment is so important, and why the [longevity data](/blog/root-canal-longevity) shows such a dramatic difference between crowned and uncrowned root canal teeth.

**Persistent infection** occurs when bacteria survive inside the root canal system despite thorough treatment. Some bacterial species form biofilms that resist the irrigating solutions used during treatment. These resilient colonies can re-establish an infection months or years later.

**Root fractures** can develop after treatment, creating a pathway for bacteria to enter the root. Vertical root fractures are particularly problematic because they often can't be seen on X-rays until they've become extensive. A tooth with a vertical root fracture typically can't be retreated and needs [extraction](/blog/root-canal-vs-extraction).

## The Signs

Root canal failure produces symptoms that are familiar because they echo the original problem, but they're usually milder and slower to develop.

**Persistent or returning pain** in the treated tooth is the most common sign. The pain might be a dull ache rather than the acute, throbbing agony of the original infection. Biting down on the tooth produces a sharp twinge. The tooth feels different from its neighbours: sensitive, tender, not quite right.

**Swelling** near the tooth, either in the gum or in the face, indicates the infection has produced an abscess at the root tip. A small bump on the gum (a sinus tract or fistula) that leaks a salty, unpleasant-tasting fluid is a classic sign of chronic infection draining from the root.

**Darkening of the tooth** can indicate internal changes, though many successfully treated root canal teeth darken over time as well, so this alone isn't diagnostic.

**X-ray findings** are often the most definitive indicator. A dark shadow at the root tip on an X-ray, indicating bone loss from chronic infection, may be found on a routine check-up X-ray even when the tooth feels fine. Asymptomatic failures happen: the infection is present, slowly destroying bone, without producing noticeable pain.

The timing varies enormously. Some failures present within months of the original treatment. Others surface years later, occasionally a decade or more. There's no "safe" point after which failure becomes impossible, but the risk diminishes significantly after the first two years.

## The Options

When a root canal has failed, three options exist: retreatment, apicoectomy, or [extraction](/blog/root-canal-vs-extraction).

### Retreatment

Root canal retreatment involves reopening the tooth, removing the previous filling material from the canals, cleaning and reshaping the canals more thoroughly, and refilling them.

The procedure is more complex than the original root canal. The existing crown or filling must be removed (or drilled through). The old filling material, usually gutta-percha, must be dissolved and removed from each canal. Any missed canals need to be found and cleaned. Posts or other internal restorations may need removing.

Retreatment takes longer than the original procedure: 2-3 hours for a molar, spread over one or two visits. The success rate for retreatment is approximately 80%, lower than the 85-95% for initial treatment, but still very good odds.

Cost: £700-£1,800, depending on the tooth and whether a specialist endodontist performs the work. A new crown is usually needed after retreatment, adding £400-£650 to the total.

### Apicoectomy

An apicoectomy (root-end surgery) approaches the problem from the other end, literally. Instead of working through the crown of the tooth, the dentist or oral surgeon makes an incision in the gum, exposes the tip of the root, removes the infected tip along with a few millimetres of root, and seals the remaining root end with a filling material.

This approach is used when retreatment isn't practical: when a post is cemented inside the root canal and can't be safely removed, when the original root canal appears adequate but infection persists at the tip, or when the tooth's crown restoration is recent and expensive and you'd rather not remove it.

Apicoectomy takes about 45-90 minutes. Recovery is similar to a [surgical extraction](/blog/surgical-vs-simple-tooth-extraction): swelling for a few days, stitches that dissolve in a week, and a return to normal within 7-10 days. Success rates are 85-95%, comparable to initial root canal treatment.

Cost: £500-£1,500, depending on the tooth and whether a specialist performs the surgery.

### Extraction

If neither retreatment nor apicoectomy is viable, or if the tooth has a vertical root fracture, [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk) is the definitive solution. The tooth comes out, the infection comes out with it, and the problem is permanently resolved.

The gap then needs addressing with an [implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk), [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), or [denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk), unless it's a [wisdom tooth](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) or a tooth in a non-visible position where the gap doesn't functionally matter.

## The Cost Comparison

The financial picture for a failed root canal looks like this:

| Option | Estimated Cost | Success Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retreatment + new crown | £1,100-£2,450 | ~80% |
| Apicoectomy | £500-£1,500 | 85-95% |
| Extraction + implant | £2,100-£3,600 | 95%+ |
| Extraction + bridge | £1,600-£3,600 | 90%+ |
| Extraction + denture | £400-£1,400 | N/A |

The decision balances the cost of preservation against the cost of replacement, weighted by the probability of success. For most teeth in most situations, retreatment or apicoectomy is attempted first. These are less invasive, less expensive, and keep the natural tooth. Extraction is the fallback when preservation has been exhausted.

## Preventing Failure

The most controllable factor in root canal success is what happens after the procedure. The [research is clear](/blog/root-canal-longevity): a root canal treated tooth with a proper crown lasts a median of 20 years. Without a crown, that drops to 6.5 years. The crown protects the root canal filling from bacterial contamination and protects the weakened tooth from fracture.

Delaying the crown is the single biggest risk factor for failure that patients actually control. The tooth feels fine after the root canal, the temporary filling seems to be holding, and the crown appointment gets postponed. Meanwhile, bacteria are finding their way through the temporary filling into the freshly cleaned canals. By the time the crown goes on, the recontamination may already be underway.

Getting the crown done promptly, within 2-4 weeks of the root canal, is the highest-impact thing that happens in the long-term success of the treatment.

## The Consultation

A suspected failed root canal needs assessment with an X-ray, and ideally a CT scan that reveals the three-dimensional anatomy of the tooth and any hidden canals the original treatment may have missed.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the assessment includes imaging and a thorough conversation about the options. If the tooth is causing acute pain, the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and same-day treatment is available for [infected teeth](/blog/extracting-infected-tooth-uk) and [abscesses](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk). If the tooth is a lower-grade concern, a planned consultation covers the full picture: retreatment options, referral to a specialist endodontist if needed, and the costs of each pathway.

Root canal failure is uncommon. When it happens, the options are well-established and the outcomes are good. The tooth that was saved once can often be saved again.
