Private dental check-ups cost between £40 and £120 across the UK, with most people paying somewhere around £50-£70. At UrgentCare Dental, an initial examination is [£20](/pricing), which includes a full assessment of your teeth, gums, and overall oral health.

That's genuinely on the affordable end, and it's worth understanding why prices vary so much across the country.

## Why the Range Is So Wide

The same check-up that costs £50 in Manchester might cost £95 in Edinburgh. It's the same pair of eyes looking in your mouth, the same training behind them, the same amount of time in the chair. The difference is location, overheads, and what each practice has decided the market will bear.

London prices are actually pretty middle-of-the-road for check-ups - around £60-£85 at most practices. Edinburgh consistently comes in higher, which surprises people. The South West and commuter belt towns like Guildford and Reading often exceed central London prices despite being smaller markets.

Northern cities offer the best value. Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle - you're looking at £50-£70 for a thorough check-up at a good practice. The quality isn't lower, there's just more competition and lower rent.

None of this means you should drive three hours to save £30 on a check-up. But if you're new to an area, or you've been putting off finding a dentist, it's worth knowing that prices aren't standardised and shopping around makes sense.

## What's Actually Included

A proper dental check-up is more than a quick look at your teeth. Your dentist is checking for decay, yes, but also for signs of gum disease, wear patterns that suggest grinding, early indicators of oral cancer, problems with existing fillings or crowns, and anything else that might cause trouble down the line.

Some practices include X-rays in the check-up price. Others charge separately - typically £15-£40 depending on how many images they take. Digital X-rays give your dentist a view of what's happening below the surface: decay between teeth that isn't visible yet, bone loss around the roots, issues with previous dental work.

At UrgentCare Dental, digital X-rays are included free with your examination. That [£20 check-up](/pricing) genuinely covers everything you need for a complete picture of your dental health.

A scale and polish is usually a separate appointment with the hygienist rather than part of the check-up itself. Hygienist appointments typically run £60-£100 for a 30-minute session. Some practices bundle check-ups and hygiene visits into packages, which can work out cheaper if you're planning to do both.

## How Often You Actually Need One

The old "every six months" advice isn't really one-size-fits-all. Some people genuinely need checking every six months - those with gum disease, heavy plaque build-up, or a history of decay. Others can comfortably go twelve months between check-ups without any problems developing.

Your dentist will tell you what makes sense for your mouth. If everything looks healthy and you're brushing and flossing properly, annual check-ups are often fine. If there are areas of concern, more frequent visits catch problems while they're still small and cheap to fix.

The maths works in favour of regular check-ups either way. A check-up costs £20-£70. A [filling](/blog/white-filling-costs-uk) you catch early costs £100-£250. A crown you need because you left that filling too long costs £500-£700. A [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) and crown because you left the crown too long costs £900-£1,200.

Prevention isn't just less painful than treatment. It's dramatically cheaper.

## If It's Been a While

This is the bit people worry about. They haven't seen a dentist in years, they know things aren't great in there, and they're dreading both the judgement and the bill.

Here's the thing: dentists see this all the time. People fall out of the habit, life gets busy, anxiety builds up, and suddenly it's been five years. You're not going to shock anyone. They've seen worse, guaranteed.

What usually happens is less scary than what people imagine. Yes, you might need some work - a few fillings, maybe a deep clean to get your gums back in shape. But you might also find that things are better than you feared. Teeth are surprisingly resilient, and plenty of people who've been avoiding the dentist discover they need less work than they'd built up in their heads.

The first step is just finding out where you stand. A [£20 check-up](/contact) tells you exactly what you're dealing with, what it would cost to sort out, and how urgent each thing is. No pressure to book treatment on the spot. Just information, so you can make decisions based on reality rather than anxiety.

## Finding the Right Practice

The cheapest check-up isn't automatically the best value, but neither is the most expensive one automatically the best quality. What you're looking for is a practice that's thorough, honest about what you need, and charges fairly for it.

Reviews help, but pay more attention to what people say about the experience than the star rating. Did the dentist explain things clearly? Did they feel pressured into treatment? Were there surprise charges? That's the stuff that matters.

UrgentCare Dental offers [check-ups for £20](/contact) including X-rays, which is as straightforward as pricing gets. No hidden extras, no pressure, just a proper look at your teeth and an honest conversation about what, if anything, needs attention.

Your teeth are with you for life. Keeping an eye on them is one of the easier investments you can make.
