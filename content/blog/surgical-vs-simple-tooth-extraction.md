The dentist has said you need an extraction, and then they've used one of two words that changes the picture considerably: "simple" or "surgical." Both words describe getting a tooth out. The experience, the cost, and the recovery are different enough that understanding which category your extraction falls into shapes your expectations properly.

The good news first: both types are routine. Dentists perform them constantly. The outcomes are predictably excellent. And modern anaesthesia means neither type involves pain during the procedure. The difference is really about what the dentist needs to do to access the tooth, and how much work is involved in getting it out.

## Simple Extraction

A simple extraction is for teeth that are visible in the mouth, fully erupted through the gum, and accessible with standard instruments. Front teeth, premolars, and molars that are above the gum line and not broken below the surface are typically simple extractions.

The procedure takes 15-30 minutes. Local anaesthetic numbs the area completely. The dentist uses an instrument called an elevator to loosen the tooth in its socket, rocking it gently to expand the ligament space and break the fibres holding the tooth to the bone. Then forceps grip the tooth and ease it out. There's a moment of pressure, a sensation of something giving way, and the tooth is out.

That's it. The socket is checked for any remaining fragments, gauze is placed over the site, and you're done. The whole thing, from sitting down to walking out, can be under thirty minutes.

Simple extractions cost £100-£300 at private practices across the UK. The cost varies by tooth (front teeth are generally simpler than molars) and by region (London prices run higher than elsewhere).

The [recovery](/blog/tooth-extraction-healing-timeline) from a simple extraction is the quickest: mild soreness for a day or two, return to normal eating within three to five days, and full gum healing within two weeks.

## Surgical Extraction

A surgical extraction is needed when the tooth can't be accessed with simple elevation and forceps. The tooth might be partially or fully under the gum, broken at or below the gum line, [impacted](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk) at an angle, or fused to the surrounding bone.

The procedure takes 30-60 minutes. Local anaesthetic numbs the area, and [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk) is available for patients who prefer it (at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the combined [extraction with sedation package is £695](/pricing)).

The dentist makes an incision in the gum to expose the tooth and surrounding bone. If bone is covering the tooth, a small amount is carefully removed with a surgical drill to create access. For teeth that are too large or awkwardly angled to come out whole, sectioning is used: the tooth is divided into two or three pieces with a drill, and each piece is removed individually.

Sectioning sounds alarming but is actually gentler than forcing a large tooth out whole. By cutting the tooth into smaller pieces, the dentist can remove each section through a smaller opening, reducing the amount of bone that needs to be removed and minimising surgical trauma.

Once all sections are out and the socket is clean, the gum is repositioned and closed with dissolvable stitches. The stitches dissolve on their own over 7-10 days.

Surgical extractions cost £200-£600 at private practices. [Wisdom tooth](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) surgical extractions sit at the higher end: [£549 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

Recovery from a surgical extraction takes 5-7 days for the acute phase, with more significant swelling and soreness than a simple extraction. The [full healing timeline](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-recovery) is the same as any extraction: gum closure in two weeks, bone healing in 6-8 weeks.

## What Determines Which Type You Need

The classification isn't a choice. It's determined by the tooth's anatomy, position, and condition.

**Tooth position** is the primary factor. Fully erupted teeth with intact crowns are simple extractions. Teeth that are partially or fully under the gum need surgical access. [Impacted wisdom teeth](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk) are almost always surgical.

**Tooth condition** matters. A tooth that's extensively decayed and has broken down to the gum line can't be gripped with forceps because there's nothing to grip. The dentist needs to make a gum incision and remove bone to access the root, making it surgical even though the tooth's position might otherwise allow a simple extraction.

**Root anatomy** plays a role. Teeth with curved, hooked, or widely divergent roots are harder to remove in one piece. The dentist may need to section the tooth to remove it without fracturing the roots or damaging surrounding bone. Curved roots are more common in upper molars and lower wisdom teeth.

**Bone density** around the tooth affects the approach. Dense bone that grips the tooth tightly may require some bone removal for access. This is more common in the lower jaw (mandible), which is naturally denser than the upper jaw (maxilla).

**Proximity to important structures** can make a simple extraction surgical for safety reasons. Lower teeth near the inferior alveolar nerve, or upper teeth near the maxillary sinus, may need a more controlled surgical approach to avoid damage to these structures.

The dentist determines the classification after examining the tooth and reviewing the X-ray. Sometimes a planned simple extraction becomes surgical if the tooth breaks during removal or the roots prove more complex than expected. This doesn't mean anything went wrong; it means the dentist adapted to what they found.

## The Experience: Side by Side

**Simple extraction experience:**
You sit down. The area gets numbed (2-3 minutes for the anaesthetic to take full effect). The dentist loosens and removes the tooth (5-15 minutes). Gauze is placed. You leave. Total chair time: 20-30 minutes.

Sensation during the procedure: pressure and rocking. Possibly a deep sense of something shifting in the bone. No pain (the anaesthetic handles that completely). The moment the tooth comes free is distinctive: a release of pressure, and then the tooth is just... out.

**Surgical extraction experience:**
You sit down. If having [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like), the cannula goes in and the sedation starts (you won't remember what follows). If under local anaesthetic only, the area gets numbed. The dentist works for 20-45 minutes: incision, possible bone removal, possible tooth sectioning, extraction of pieces, socket cleaning, stitching.

Sensation during the procedure (without sedation): pressure, vibration from the surgical drill (if used), the same deep sense of things happening in the bone. More duration than a simple extraction, but the same absence of pain. With sedation, you feel the initial wave of calm and then you're told it's done.

The difference in experience is primarily duration and the post-operative picture. Surgical extractions produce more swelling, more stiffness, and a longer peak-discomfort period. But the pain profile, managed with ibuprofen and paracetamol, follows the same trajectory: worst at 48 hours, improving from day three, largely resolved by day seven.

## The Cost Comparison

| | Simple | Surgical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Procedure cost | £100-£300 | £200-£600 |
| With IV sedation | £450-£700 | £550-£1,000 |
| Chair time | 20-30 mins | 30-60 mins |
| Recovery peak | 1-2 days | 2-3 days |
| Normal eating | 3-5 days | 5-7 days |
| Full gum healing | 1-2 weeks | 2-3 weeks |
| Bone healing | 6-8 weeks | 6-8 weeks |

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [wisdom tooth extraction is £549](/pricing) and the [combined extraction with sedation package is £695](/pricing). Standard extractions are competitively priced.

## When Both Happen Together

Some patients need multiple extractions in one visit: a mix of simple and surgical. A patient having all four wisdom teeth removed might have two that are partially erupted (surgical) and two that are fully through (potentially simple). Or someone with several failing teeth might have some that lift out easily and others that need surgical access.

The fee for each extraction reflects its classification. A visit with one simple and one surgical extraction is priced per tooth based on what each one requires. [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk), if used, covers the entire session regardless of how many teeth are removed, making it cost-effective for [multiple extractions](/blog/multiple-tooth-extractions).

## The Outcome Is the Same

Here's the thing that matters most: the outcome doesn't differ between simple and surgical extractions. The tooth is out. The socket heals. The problem is solved.

Surgical extractions take longer, cost more, and have a more involved recovery. But they achieve the same result as a simple extraction for teeth that can't be removed simply. The surgical approach exists because some teeth need it, and the recovery, while a bit longer, follows the same predictable, manageable pattern.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the assessment before any extraction includes an X-ray that shows exactly what's involved. Whether the extraction is simple or surgical, the process, cost, and recovery timeline are discussed before anything happens. No surprises, no unexpected changes to the plan.

The word "surgical" carries weight. But the reality behind it is a skilled dentist adapting their approach to the specific tooth. The outcome, a gap where a problem used to be, is the same either way.
