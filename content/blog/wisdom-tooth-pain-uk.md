It starts at the back of your mouth. A dull pressure that wasn't there yesterday. Your tongue keeps drifting to the spot, pressing against something tender. By the evening, the ache has spread along your jaw. By bedtime, it's throbbing.

Wisdom tooth pain has a particular quality to it. It's deeper than a regular toothache, more diffuse, harder to pinpoint. It radiates. Into your ear, your temple, the hinge of your jaw. You press your cheek and the whole area feels swollen from the inside, even if the mirror shows nothing different.

And the timing is impeccable: it arrives at night, when you're lying down and the blood pressure to your head increases, when there's nothing to distract you from it, when everything feels worse.

Here's what's worth knowing right away: wisdom tooth pain always has a cause, the cause is almost always identifiable, and the fix is almost always straightforward. The pain feels like a crisis. The solution, in most cases, is a dental appointment and a clear plan.

## The Five Types of Wisdom Tooth Pain

Wisdom tooth pain isn't one thing. It comes from several distinct sources, and recognising which type you're experiencing points directly at what's happening and what needs to happen next.

**Eruption pain** is the most common and the most benign. The wisdom tooth is pushing through the gum, and the tissue around it is stretching, tearing slightly, and inflaming. It's the same process that made teething babies miserable, just happening twenty years later. Eruption pain tends to come in waves: a few days of soreness as the tooth moves, then quiet, then another episode as it pushes further.

Eruption pain typically resolves on its own once the tooth is through. If the tooth has room to emerge fully, the gum heals around it and the discomfort fades. Ibuprofen manages the inflammation, and salt water rinses soothe the irritated tissue. No dental treatment needed.

**[Pericoronitis](/blog/pericoronitis-treatment-uk)** is what happens when eruption doesn't complete. The tooth partially emerges, leaving a flap of gum tissue draped over the still-submerged portion. That flap, the operculum, creates a pocket where food and bacteria accumulate. The area becomes infected, and the pain goes from "uncomfortable pressure" to "throbbing, swollen, can barely open my mouth."

Pericoronitis pain is sharp, localised to the area behind the last molar, and often accompanied by swelling in the gum, a foul taste, and difficulty opening the jaw fully. It's the most common reason wisdom teeth become [emergency dental appointments](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk).

**Cavity pain** develops when a wisdom tooth (either partially erupted or fully through) develops decay. Wisdom teeth sit at the very back of the mouth where brushing is awkward and flossing is nearly impossible. They're uniquely vulnerable to cavities, and the decay can progress significantly before anyone notices.

Cavity pain in a wisdom tooth is similar to cavity pain anywhere else: sensitivity to hot, cold, and sweet initially, progressing to a constant ache as the decay reaches deeper into the tooth.

**Pressure pain from impaction** occurs when an [impacted wisdom tooth](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk) pushes against the neighbouring molar. The force transmits through the dental arch, creating a deep, aching pressure that's hard to localise. Patients often say the pain seems to come from multiple teeth at once, and they can't tell which one is the problem.

This type of pain can cause headaches, earache, and jaw joint discomfort. The referred pain pattern makes it confusing: a wisdom tooth in the lower left jaw can produce pain that feels like it's in the ear or the temple on the same side.

**Abscess pain** is the most intense. An infection at the root tip of a wisdom tooth creates a pocket of pus that builds pressure against the surrounding bone. The pain is deep, throbbing, constant, and barely touched by over-the-counter painkillers. [Facial swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache) often accompanies it, and the area becomes hot and extremely tender to touch.

## The Night Problem

Wisdom tooth pain is famously worse at night, and there's a physiological reason for it.

When you lie down, blood flow to the head increases. The blood pressure in the tissues around the inflamed wisdom tooth rises, and the swelling intensifies. The nerve endings, already irritated, receive more pressure. The pain that was a 4 during the day becomes a 7 at 2am.

There's also the absence of distraction. During the day, your brain is processing a hundred things: work, conversations, screens, movement. At night, lying in the dark, there's nothing competing with the pain for attention. Your entire conscious awareness contracts to that one throbbing spot at the back of your jaw.

Sleeping propped up on extra pillows helps by reducing blood pressure to the head. Taking ibuprofen before bed provides anti-inflammatory coverage through the night. And a cold compress against the outside of the jaw (a bag of frozen peas, wrapped in a towel) numbs the area temporarily.

These measures manage the night. The dentist manages the cause.

## What the Dentist Finds

Walking into the appointment, here's what the assessment looks like.

A visual examination of the area behind the last molar. The dentist checks for swelling, redness, pus, partial eruption, and the condition of the gum tissue. A probe gently explores around the wisdom tooth, checking for pockets, decay, and the extent of any infection.

An X-ray shows what's happening below the surface: the tooth's angle, its depth, whether it's impacted, whether there's decay, whether there's infection at the root tip, and how close the roots sit to the inferior alveolar nerve.

Within a few minutes, the dentist knows which of the five pain types is at play and what the treatment plan looks like.

## The Treatment and What It Costs

Treatment depends entirely on the cause.

**For eruption pain** with a tooth that has room to come through: no active treatment. The pain is managed with over-the-counter painkillers and resolves as the tooth emerges. The appointment confirms this is what's happening and provides reassurance. An emergency assessment at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) costs [£20](/pricing).

**For pericoronitis**: [antibiotics](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) to clear the infection (£9.90 for the prescription in England), irrigation under the gum flap to remove trapped debris, and a decision about whether the tooth should be [removed](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) to prevent recurrence. Pericoronitis has a habit of coming back, and recurrent episodes strengthen the case for extraction.

**For decay**: if the cavity is accessible and the tooth is in a usable position, a filling might be appropriate (£99-£250). More often, a decayed wisdom tooth is better extracted than filled, because the position makes it difficult to restore properly and the tooth isn't essential for chewing.

**For impaction pressure**: the [impacted tooth](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk) is assessed for removal. If it's pressing on the neighbouring molar and causing damage, extraction is the clear recommendation. If it's causing intermittent pressure without structural damage, monitoring might be appropriate.

**For abscess**: antibiotics first to control the infection, then extraction once the area has settled. The sequence matters: extracting from [infected tissue](/blog/extracting-infected-tooth-uk) is harder and heals worse than extracting from healthy tissue. Antibiotics buy the window for a better surgical outcome.

Wisdom tooth extraction at UrgentCare Dental costs [£549 per tooth](/pricing). With [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like), the combined package is [£695](/pricing). Across the UK, wisdom tooth removal runs £200-£600 per tooth.

## Pain Relief That Actually Works

While you're waiting for the dental appointment, or while antibiotics are doing their work, the pain needs managing.

Ibuprofen (400mg every 6-8 hours) is the front-line choice because it's both a painkiller and an anti-inflammatory. The inflammation around a wisdom tooth is a major component of the pain, and ibuprofen directly addresses it.

Paracetamol (1000mg every 4-6 hours) can be taken alongside ibuprofen. They work on different pain pathways and the combination is more effective than either alone. Alternating the two, so you're taking one or the other every 3-4 hours, provides continuous coverage.

Clove oil applied directly to the painful area with a cotton bud provides localised numbing. The eugenol in clove oil is a genuine analgesic used in dental products. It tastes strongly of cloves (unsurprisingly) and the relief is temporary but real.

Salt water rinses (a teaspoon of salt in warm water, gently swished) reduce bacterial load around the tooth and soothe inflamed gum tissue. For pericoronitis specifically, these rinses help keep the area under the gum flap clean.

A cold compress against the outer cheek, 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, reduces swelling and numbs the area. It's particularly helpful at night when the pain tends to peak.

These are management measures, not solutions. They keep the pain bearable while the underlying cause gets sorted. The cause is always the tooth, and the tooth needs a dentist.

## The Bigger Question

Wisdom tooth pain is the moment when a lot of people confront a decision they've been deferring.

The dentist mentioned the wisdom teeth years ago. They showed up on an X-ray, impacted or partially erupted, and the suggestion was made to have them out. And you filed it under "maybe later" because they weren't causing problems and life was busy and it didn't feel urgent.

Now it's urgent. The pain has made the decision for you, and the choice is no longer "deal with it now or later." It's "deal with it now, or deal with it again in three months when the next flare-up arrives."

Recurring wisdom tooth pain, particularly from pericoronitis, follows a cycle: infection, antibiotics, relief, quiet period, reinfection. Each cycle costs an emergency appointment and a course of antibiotics. Three cycles over a year costs more in aggregate than a single [extraction](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk) that ends the cycle permanently.

The extraction is the full stop. The pain stops. The infections stop. The 2am throbbing stops. And the [recovery](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-recovery), while not fun, takes a week. One week of soup and ibuprofen, and then it's done.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the path from wisdom tooth pain to resolution starts with a [£20 emergency appointment](/pricing). The assessment, the X-ray, the diagnosis, the plan. The pain has a name, a cause, and a clear path to being over.

And the 2am version of you, the one lying in the dark with a throbbing jaw, wondering whether this will ever stop? That version gets to rest.
