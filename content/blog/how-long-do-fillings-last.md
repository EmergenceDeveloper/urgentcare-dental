The filling went in five years ago. Or ten. Or fifteen. And now there's something happening near it: a dark shadow at the edge, a rough spot the tongue keeps finding, a twinge of sensitivity that wasn't there before. And the question forms: is this filling done?

Fillings don't last forever. This sounds like a limitation, but reframe it: fillings last a remarkably long time considering they sit inside a biological structure that's bathed in saliva, exposed to temperature extremes from hot coffee to ice cream, subjected to crushing forces up to 70kg per square centimetre during chewing, and colonised by billions of bacteria. The engineering challenge of making something survive in those conditions for a decade is considerable. Most fillings do it casually.

## The Lifespan Numbers

Different filling materials have different expected lifespans, and the numbers come from large-scale studies tracking tens of thousands of fillings over years of clinical service.

**Composite (white) fillings** last 7-10 years on average. The range is wide: small fillings in low-stress areas can last 15+ years, while large fillings on biting surfaces of molars may need replacing after 5-7 years. The median from meta-analyses sits around 7-8 years.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [composite fillings cost £99-£250](/pricing), depending on the size and location.

**[Amalgam](/blog/amalgam-vs-white-fillings) (silver) fillings** last 10-15 years on average, with many lasting 20+ years. Amalgam's longevity advantage over composite is well-documented: it's more resistant to wear, more tolerant of moisture during placement, and more forgiving of technique variation. Large amalgam fillings in molars routinely outlast large composite fillings in the same location.

**Glass ionomer fillings** last 5-7 years. These are used primarily for specific applications: fillings near the gum line, temporary fillings, and fillings in deciduous (baby) teeth. They release fluoride, which provides some protection against decay at the filling margins, but their wear resistance is lower than either composite or amalgam.

**Gold inlays and onlays** last 15-30 years, the longest of any direct restorative material. They're also the most expensive and the least aesthetically discreet, which is why they've largely been replaced by ceramic alternatives for most patients.

**Ceramic inlays and onlays** last 10-15 years, combining excellent aesthetics with durability that exceeds direct composite fillings. These are laboratory-fabricated restorations cemented into the prepared cavity, rather than composite packed directly into the tooth.

## Why Fillings Fail

Fillings don't just dissolve or disappear. They fail through specific mechanisms, and understanding these mechanisms explains why the same filling lasts seven years in one mouth and fifteen in another.

**Marginal breakdown** is the most common failure mode. The junction between filling and tooth, the margin, is a seam. Over thousands of chewing cycles, this seam develops micro-gaps. Bacteria colonise these gaps. Decay develops at the margin, undermining the filling from its edges. The filling itself may be intact, but the tooth around it is failing.

This process accelerates with large fillings (more margin length to fail) and fillings on biting surfaces (more force across the margin). It's why small fillings generally outlast large ones: less margin, less opportunity for failure.

**Fracture** occurs when filling material cracks under repeated stress. Composite is more susceptible to fracture than amalgam, particularly in large restorations on molars where the filling absorbs heavy chewing forces. The fracture may be visible (a piece chips off) or invisible (a crack within the filling that allows bacterial penetration).

**Secondary decay** is new decay developing at the margins of an existing filling. It's the most common reason fillings are replaced, accounting for 50-60% of filling replacements. The original cavity was treated, but the same mouth conditions (diet, bacteria, oral hygiene) that caused the first cavity continue operating at the filling's edges.

**Wear** affects the biting surface of the filling over time. Composite wears faster than enamel, gradually losing height and surface contour. As the filling surface wears, the bite changes subtly, and the opposing tooth may over-erupt slightly into the space. This process takes years and is more significant in large fillings.

**Debonding** occurs when the adhesive connection between composite filling and tooth fails. The filling may feel loose, or a gap may appear between filling and tooth. Unlike amalgam (which is mechanically locked into the cavity by undercuts), composite relies entirely on its adhesive bond. If that bond fails, the filling can loosen or fall out.

## The Signs a Filling Needs Replacing

Some signs are obvious. Others are subtle enough that only a dental examination catches them.

**Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet** around a filled tooth suggests the filling's seal has been compromised. Fluid is reaching the dentin beneath the filling, stimulating the nerve. This sensitivity is diagnostically useful: it distinguishes a failing filling from a healthy one.

**A rough edge or step** that the tongue detects at the filling margin indicates material has chipped or worn away. The tongue is extraordinarily sensitive to surface changes: it can detect variations of 0.01mm, which is why a tiny chip in a filling feels enormous.

**Visible dark lines** around the filling suggest either staining at the margin (cosmetic, not necessarily problematic) or decay developing at the edge (definitely problematic). The dentist distinguishes between the two using a probe and X-ray.

**The filling falls out** or a piece breaks off. This is the unambiguous sign. A filling that's come out leaves exposed dentin that's vulnerable to temperature sensitivity, decay, and fracture. This is best addressed promptly, within days rather than weeks.

**Pain when biting** on the filled tooth can indicate a crack in the filling, a crack in the tooth beneath the filling, or secondary decay that's reaching the nerve. This symptom warrants assessment because it may indicate a problem that's progressed beyond simple filling replacement.

**X-ray findings** catch problems that produce no symptoms. A dark shadow around the filling on an X-ray indicates decay that's developing silently. This is one of the arguments for regular dental check-ups: catching failing fillings before they produce symptoms allows simpler, less expensive treatment.

## What Determines Longevity

Some factors are inherent to the filling. Others are within the patient's control.

**Filling size** is the strongest predictor. Small fillings last longer than large fillings, regardless of material. A small filling in a premolar can last 15+ years. A large filling replacing most of a molar's biting surface faces higher stress and has more margin to fail: 5-7 years is a realistic expectation.

**Location in the mouth** matters. Front teeth fillings last longer than molar fillings because the forces on them are lower. Upper teeth fillings tend to outlast lower teeth fillings, partly because the lower jaw generates more force and partly because gravity helps saliva drain from upper surfaces more readily.

**Bite forces** vary between individuals. Someone who [grinds their teeth](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) at night subjects their fillings to forces many times greater than normal chewing. Bruxism dramatically shortens filling lifespan, particularly for composite fillings on molar biting surfaces.

**Oral hygiene** affects the rate of secondary decay at the margins. Thorough brushing and flossing removes the bacteria that would otherwise colonise the filling margins and initiate new decay. People with excellent oral hygiene get measurably longer life from their fillings.

**Diet** influences decay rates. Frequent sugar consumption, acidic drinks, and snacking between meals create an oral environment that promotes decay at filling margins. The original cavity formed because of the oral environment; if that environment doesn't change, the replacement filling faces the same pressures.

**Placement technique** matters, though this is the dentist's domain rather than the patient's. Composite fillings are technique-sensitive: moisture contamination during placement, inadequate curing light exposure, or improper layering can compromise the bond and reduce longevity. Amalgam is more forgiving of technique variation, which partly explains its longevity advantage.

## When a Filling Fails: What Happens

A failing filling has three possible trajectories.

**Filling replacement** is the most common outcome. The old filling is removed along with any decay at the margins, and a new filling is placed. If the cavity hasn't grown significantly, this is straightforward: same procedure as the original filling, slightly larger. Cost: similar to the original filling.

**Crown** becomes necessary when the cavity has grown large enough that a filling won't adequately restore the tooth's strength. A tooth that's more filling than tooth is structurally vulnerable. A [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) covers the entire tooth, providing the structural support that a filling alone can't. Cost: [£650 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

**[Root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk)** is needed if decay beneath the failing filling has reached the nerve. A filling that's been leaking bacteria for months may have allowed infection to reach the pulp. The tooth is saved with root canal treatment, but the complexity and cost increase substantially. Cost: £600-£1,400 for the root canal, plus a crown.

The progression from filling replacement to crown to root canal is a cost escalation that underlines the value of catching failing fillings early. A filling replaced at the first sign of marginal decay costs £99-£250. The same tooth, left until the decay reaches the nerve, costs £1,250-£2,050 (root canal plus crown). Timing matters.

## Extending Filling Life

Regular dental check-ups catch failing fillings in the replacement window rather than the root canal window. An X-ray every 12-24 months monitors filling margins for early decay.

A [night guard](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) for people who grind their teeth protects fillings from the excessive forces that shorten their lifespan. The cost of a night guard (£100-£300) is a fraction of the premature filling replacements it prevents.

Good oral hygiene at the filling margins reduces secondary decay. The toothbrush can't distinguish between tooth surface and filling surface, and it doesn't need to: cleaning both with the same thoroughness protects the critical junction between them.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the dental check-up includes assessment of all existing fillings, with X-rays to detect early marginal issues. When replacement is needed, the options ([composite fillings from £99](/pricing), [crowns at £650](/pricing)) are discussed before any work begins.

Fillings are temporary solutions to permanent problems. They buy time, and the amount of time they buy, 7 years or 20 years, depends on a combination of the material, the size, the mouth they're in, and the care they receive. Understanding the expected lifespan makes planning straightforward: not if a filling will need replacing, but when, and being ready when that time comes.
