The filling is done. The anaesthetic wore off two hours ago. And now the tooth that was fine (apart from the cavity) before the appointment is producing sensations it wasn't producing before. A zing when you drink cold water. A twinge when you bite down. A low-grade ache that sits in the background of your awareness. And the thought that arrives with these sensations: did something go wrong?

Almost certainly not. Post-filling sensitivity is one of the most common experiences in dentistry, and understanding why it happens, how long it lasts, and what would actually indicate a problem turns a worrying few days into a manageable transition.

## What's Normal

### Sensitivity to Temperature

The most common post-filling sensation. Cold water, cold air, hot coffee, ice cream: any temperature extreme produces a sharp, brief zing in the filled tooth. The sensation is transient: it lasts a few seconds and stops when the temperature stimulus is removed.

This happens because the filling procedure disturbed the tooth's inner structure. The drill removed decayed tooth tissue, generating heat and vibration that irritated the dentin and the nerve beneath it. The tooth is inflamed at a microscopic level: the pulp tissue (the nerve) is mildly irritated and hyper-responsive to stimuli that wouldn't normally register.

Duration: 1-2 weeks for most fillings. Deeper fillings (closer to the nerve) may produce sensitivity that lasts 4-6 weeks. The sensitivity decreases gradually rather than disappearing overnight.

### Bite Sensitivity

Pain when biting down on the filled tooth, particularly when chewing something firm. This is typically a high spot: the filling material is slightly too high, contacting the opposing tooth before the other teeth meet. The premature contact concentrates all the biting force on one point, producing a sharp pain.

High spots are common because the filling was placed and shaped while the tooth was numb. The patient couldn't feel whether the bite was even, and the articulating paper (the thin marking paper used to check the bite) may not have caught a subtle discrepancy.

Solution: a 5-minute adjustment appointment where the dentist selectively grinds down the high spot until the bite is even. The pain resolves immediately. This is a routine follow-up and not charged separately at most practices.

If bite sensitivity persists after the high spot has been adjusted, the filling may be causing the tooth to flex under load (particularly with large composite fillings that shrink slightly during curing). This flexing irritates the nerve and produces a biting pain that takes 2-4 weeks to settle as the tooth adapts.

### General Achiness

A low-grade, dull ache in and around the filled tooth for the first 24-48 hours. The tooth was worked on: it was drilled, dried, etched with acid, bonded, and filled. The process is invasive, even though it's routine. A general achiness in the aftermath is the tooth expressing its displeasure, and it resolves with over-the-counter painkillers (ibuprofen is ideal because it's anti-inflammatory).

### Sensitivity to Sweets

Sugar sensitivity in the filled tooth, particularly at the filling margins, is common for the first week. The margins where filling meets tooth are the most vulnerable point, and until the filling has fully settled and the tooth has remineralised around the margins, sweet foods can trigger a brief sharp sensation.

## What's Not Normal

### Pain That Gets Worse Over Time

Normal post-filling sensitivity follows a predictable arc: worst in the first 24-48 hours, improving gradually, and largely resolved within 1-2 weeks. Pain that instead increases over days or weeks, getting progressively worse rather than better, suggests a problem.

Possible causes:

**Irreversible pulpitis.** The filling procedure stressed the nerve beyond its ability to recover. The nerve, already compromised by the original decay, was further irritated by the drilling, and it's now dying. The pain transitions from sensitivity to spontaneous [throbbing](/blog/toothache-at-night): aching without any stimulus, waking you at night, and responding poorly to painkillers. This tooth needs [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk).

**Infection developing.** If bacteria were present at the base of the cavity when the filling was placed (or if the filling doesn't seal completely), infection can develop in the pulp. Symptoms escalate from sensitivity to persistent pain, tenderness to pressure, and possibly [swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache).

### Spontaneous Throbbing

Pain that occurs without any trigger, spontaneous aching or throbbing in the filled tooth, is a red flag for nerve damage. A healthy tooth with a healthy nerve doesn't throb on its own. Spontaneous pain indicates the pulp is significantly inflamed or dying.

If the throbbing is particularly [worse at night](/blog/toothache-at-night) (when lying down increases blood flow to the head), and ibuprofen is barely effective, the diagnosis is almost certainly irreversible pulpitis. Root canal treatment is the next step.

### Lingering Pain After Temperature

Normal post-filling sensitivity produces a brief zing from cold or hot that stops within 5-10 seconds of removing the stimulus. If the pain lingers for 30 seconds, a minute, or longer after the temperature stimulus is removed, the nerve is more significantly compromised.

Lingering pain (particularly to heat) indicates a nerve that's transitioning from reversible to irreversible inflammation. This tooth needs monitoring closely, and if the lingering pain persists beyond 2 weeks, [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) may be needed.

### Pain When Not Eating

A filled tooth that aches continuously, not just when eating or drinking, suggests problems that go beyond normal post-operative sensitivity. Continuous pain points to nerve involvement, infection, or a [crack](/blog/cracked-tooth-treatment-uk) in the tooth that's been revealed or exacerbated by the filling procedure.

## Why Deeper Fillings Cause More Sensitivity

The proximity of the filling to the nerve determines the intensity and duration of post-filling sensitivity.

A shallow filling (removing enamel decay only) is well-insulated from the nerve by thick dentin. Post-operative sensitivity is minimal to none.

A moderate filling (removing decay through the enamel and into the dentin) exposes dentin tubules: microscopic channels that connect the filling to the nerve. Sensitivity is common and typically resolves within 1-2 weeks.

A deep filling (removing decay close to the nerve) leaves a thin layer of dentin between the filling and the pulp. The nerve is directly affected by the procedure: the heat of drilling, the cold of air and water, the acid etch and bonding agents all reach the nerve through the thin remaining dentin. Sensitivity can be significant and may last 4-6 weeks.

An extremely deep filling (where decay was found very close to the nerve) is a clinical judgment call. The dentist may have chosen to fill the tooth rather than proceed immediately to [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), giving the nerve a chance to recover. This "watch and wait" approach is valid: many teeth with deep fillings recover fully. But the risk of the nerve not recovering (requiring root canal later) is higher for these fillings.

The dentist communicates this risk at the time of the filling. If they mention that the decay was "deep" or "close to the nerve," this is the context: the filling may be fine, but the tooth bears watching, and extended sensitivity is expected.

## The Timeline for Concern

**Days 1-3:** sensitivity to temperature and bite is expected and normal. Manage with ibuprofen and paracetamol if needed.

**Days 3-7:** sensitivity should be improving. If it's stable or slightly worse, it's still within the normal range for deeper fillings. Continue monitoring.

**Weeks 1-2:** most sensitivity has resolved. If bite sensitivity persists, book an adjustment appointment. If temperature sensitivity persists but is improving, continue monitoring.

**Weeks 2-4:** lingering temperature sensitivity in this window may be normal for deep fillings. Spontaneous pain, worsening pain, or throbbing is not normal and needs assessment.

**Beyond 4 weeks:** any continuing sensitivity beyond a month warrants a dental appointment. The tooth may have [pulpitis](/blog/does-root-canal-hurt) that's not resolving, and waiting longer risks the nerve dying and an [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) forming.

## Managing Post-Filling Sensitivity

Ibuprofen (400mg every 6-8 hours) is the most effective option because it addresses the inflammation causing the sensitivity. Paracetamol provides additional analgesic support.

Desensitising toothpaste (containing potassium nitrate) can reduce sensitivity when used for 1-2 weeks. The potassium ions calm the nerve endings in the dentin tubules, reducing their reactivity to stimuli.

Avoiding temperature extremes on the filled side for the first few days reduces the frequency of sensitivity episodes. Eating on the other side, drinking through a straw (to bypass the filled tooth), and avoiding ice-cold drinks or very hot coffee on that side are practical measures.

Soft foods for the first 24 hours, particularly if the filling is large, reduce bite-related sensitivity. Returning to normal eating happens naturally as the sensitivity improves.

## When to Call

The decision to contact the dentist is straightforward:

**High spot:** if the filled tooth hits before the other teeth when you bite down, book an adjustment. This is quick and resolves the problem immediately.

**Worsening pain:** if the pain is getting worse instead of better after the first few days, call the practice.

**Spontaneous pain:** if the tooth throbs without any trigger, particularly at night, call for an assessment.

**No improvement after 2 weeks:** persistent, unchanged sensitivity beyond two weeks warrants a check.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), post-filling concerns are handled promptly. Bite adjustments are quick appointments. Assessments for persistent sensitivity include testing the nerve response and X-ray to check the filling's position relative to the nerve. If root canal treatment is needed, it's available at the same practice, including with [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) if desired.

Most post-filling sensitivity is the tooth adjusting to its new reality. The drill removed disease and left a restoration. The nerve, briefly bothered, settles down. And within a week or two, the tooth that was producing concerning sensations goes quiet, and you forget the filling is there.

That forgetting is the goal. And for the vast majority of fillings, it happens right on schedule.
