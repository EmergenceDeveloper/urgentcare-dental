The idea of a dental implant is easy enough to grasp: a titanium screw goes into your jawbone, a tooth goes on top, and you carry on with your life. Simple concept. But between "deciding to get an implant" and "eating a steak with your new tooth," there's a sequence of events that most people know almost nothing about, and the unknown is where the anxiety lives.

So here's all of it. Every stage, every appointment, every weird sensation and quiet milestone. The full picture, from the first phone call to the moment you forget you even have an implant because it feels so completely like a real tooth.

## The Consultation

Everything starts here, and it's less clinical than you might expect.

You sit down with the dentist and talk about the gap. When did you lose the tooth? What's been happening since? What are your concerns? This conversation matters more than it seems, because your history shapes the treatment plan.

Then the diagnostic part. A CT scan produces a three-dimensional image of your jawbone. Not a flat X-ray; a full 3D map showing bone density, bone width, bone height, the position of nerves and sinuses, and the exact anatomy of the area where the implant will go.

The dentist studies this scan like an architect studying a building site. They're measuring the available bone in three dimensions, identifying the densest bone for implant placement, checking whether any preparatory work like [bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) is needed, and determining the optimal angle for the implant.

By the end of the consultation, you know: whether you're a candidate, what the treatment plan looks like, how long it will take, and what it costs. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), a [single implant is £1,999](/pricing). The consultation is where the commitment begins, but only when you're ready.

## The Planning Phase

Between the consultation and surgery, something remarkable happens in digital space.

Using the CT scan data, the implant position is planned on screen. Specialised software lets the dentist virtually place the implant into your jawbone, adjusting the angle, depth, and position until it's optimal. They can see exactly where the implant will sit relative to nerves, sinuses, and neighbouring teeth.

Some practices create a surgical guide from this digital plan: a 3D-printed template that fits over your teeth during surgery and directs the drill to the exact planned position. It's like a stencil for your jawbone. The drill goes through a pre-set channel in the guide, making the placement precisely match the digital plan.

This level of planning is why modern implant surgery has the success rates it does. By the time the surgeon picks up a drill, they've already placed the implant digitally, checked the result from every angle, and know exactly what they're going to do. The surgery itself is the execution of a thoroughly rehearsed plan.

## Surgery Day

This is the part that looms largest in people's imaginations, and it's also the part that's most consistently described as "surprisingly okay" by people who've been through it.

You arrive at the practice. If you've opted for [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) (£399 at UrgentCare Dental), that starts first: the cannula, the calm, the gentle disconnect from anxiety. If you're having local anaesthetic only, the area gets numbed thoroughly. Either way, you won't feel pain during the procedure. That's not a reassurance; it's a fact. The anaesthetic ensures it.

The gum tissue over the implant site is opened with a small incision. The bone beneath is visible. Using a series of precisely sized drills, each slightly larger than the last, the surgeon creates a channel in the bone. It's called an osteotomy, and it takes a few minutes.

There's a sensation here that people often ask about: you can feel vibration and pressure during the drilling, particularly a deep sense of something happening inside the bone. It's unusual, but it's not painful. The bone itself doesn't have nerve endings in the way that skin and gums do. The pressure sensation comes from the surrounding tissues.

The drill sequence is graduated. A thin pilot drill goes first, creating the initial channel. Then progressively wider drills open it to the exact diameter of the implant. The final drill creates a channel that matches the implant with surgical precision.

Then the implant goes in. A titanium cylinder, typically 3.5-5mm wide and 8-13mm long, threaded like a very fine screw. It's placed into the prepared channel and gently turned until it reaches the planned depth. There's a specific tactile feel the surgeon looks for: primary stability, meaning the implant grips the bone firmly enough to stay put from day one.

The gum is closed over the implant with a few stitches. A small healing cap might sit above the gum line, or the implant might be fully buried beneath the gum depending on the approach.

Total surgery time for a single implant: 30-60 minutes. For most patients, the experience is remarkably unremarkable. The anxiety beforehand dwarfs the reality of the procedure itself.

## The Quiet Months

This is the stage that takes the longest and requires the least from you. It's also where the most extraordinary thing happens.

Osseointegration. Your jawbone grows into the titanium surface of the implant at a microscopic level. The bone doesn't just sit next to the implant; it physically bonds with it, growing into the tiny textures and coatings on the titanium surface. Over 3-6 months, the implant becomes part of your skeleton.

The biology of this is genuinely remarkable. Titanium is one of very few materials that bone will fuse with rather than reject. When Paulo Brånemark discovered this in 1952 (accidentally, while studying blood flow in rabbit bone), he coined the term osseointegration and spent the next two decades proving it could support dental prosthetics. Everything that followed, every dental implant ever placed, traces back to that moment.

During these months, you're living your normal life. If the tooth was in a visible area, you'll have a temporary tooth to fill the gap (either a temporary crown, a small removable denture, or a bonded bridge to the adjacent teeth). You eat normally (avoiding very hard foods directly on the healing site for the first few weeks), you brush normally, you go about your business.

Check-up appointments happen at intervals to monitor healing. The dentist checks that the gum is healthy, that there's no infection, and that things are progressing as expected. These are quick visits: a look, sometimes an X-ray, confirmation that everything's on track.

The temptation during this phase is impatience. The implant is in, the gap is filled with a temporary, and you want the final tooth. But the healing time is non-negotiable. The bond between bone and titanium needs to reach full strength before the implant can take the load of a permanent crown. Rushing this step is the surest way to compromise an otherwise excellent outcome.

## The Reveal Appointment

Once osseointegration is confirmed (usually through clinical testing and X-rays), the second phase begins.

If the implant was buried beneath the gum, a small procedure uncovers it: a tiny incision, the healing cap is exposed or replaced with a slightly larger one that shapes the gum tissue around it. This is a minor procedure, often done without anaesthetic or with just a touch of topical numbing.

Then impressions. Digital or traditional, the dentist captures the exact position of the implant and the surrounding teeth. These impressions go to a dental lab where the final crown is crafted.

The lab work is an art form in its own right. The technician builds a crown that matches your natural teeth in colour, shape, and translucency. They reference the shade of your adjacent teeth, the shape of your bite, the way light passes through natural enamel. The goal is invisibility: a crown that looks so natural nobody, including you, can tell which tooth is the implant.

This lab phase takes 1-3 weeks. You're still wearing the temporary during this time.

## The Final Fitting

The appointment everyone's been waiting for.

The temporary comes out. The permanent crown is placed onto the abutment (the connecting piece between implant and crown). The dentist checks the bite, the fit, the colour match. Minor adjustments happen chair-side: a tiny bit of shaping here, a polish there.

And then it's done. You look in the mirror and see a tooth. A completely natural-looking tooth in the exact spot where there used to be a gap. It's the same shade as its neighbours. It catches the light the same way. Your tongue runs across it and finds a smooth, natural surface.

The first time you bite down on something with the new tooth is a small, private moment that's surprisingly emotional for a lot of people. The gap is gone. The tooth is back. And it feels completely, unmistakably real.

## What the Timeline Looks Like Overall

From first consultation to final crown, a single implant takes approximately:

A straightforward case with good bone: 3-6 months total. Consultation and planning (1-2 weeks), surgery (one appointment), healing (3-4 months), crown fitting (1-2 appointments over 2-3 weeks).

A case requiring [bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk): 7-12 months total. The graft adds 4-6 months of healing before the implant can be placed, then the standard 3-4 months of osseointegration.

A case involving extraction, grafting, and implant: 9-15 months total. Extraction with socket preservation (one appointment), graft healing (3-4 months), implant placement (one appointment), osseointegration (3-6 months), crown (1-2 appointments).

These timelines feel long when you're looking at them from the starting line. From the finishing line, looking back, they feel like they went remarkably quickly. And the result, a permanent tooth that lasts 20-30 years or more, makes the months of healing feel proportionate.

## The Cost at Each Stage

Understanding where the money goes within the overall implant cost takes the mystery out of the investment.

The consultation and CT scan: £0-£200 depending on the practice. Some fold this into the total; others charge separately.

The implant surgery: this is the largest component, covering the surgeon's time, the implant fixture, the surgical kit, the anaesthetic, and the immediate aftercare.

The abutment and crown: the visible tooth component, including lab fabrication and fitting appointments.

At UrgentCare Dental, the [£1,999 per implant](/pricing) covers the complete treatment pathway. The consultation, the CT scan, the surgery, the implant, the abutment, the crown, and the follow-up appointments. One price for the whole thing, with [payment plans available](/blog/dental-implant-payment-plans-uk) to spread the cost.

## Life After the Implant

Once the crown is on, the implant becomes invisible in your daily life. You brush it like a natural tooth. You floss around it like a natural tooth. You eat with it like a natural tooth.

Annual check-ups keep an eye on things. The dentist checks the gum health around the implant, takes an occasional X-ray to confirm the bone level is stable, and gives the crown a polish. That's the extent of the maintenance.

Implants don't decay (they're titanium and ceramic, not biological tissue). But the gum around them can become inflamed if plaque builds up, a condition called peri-implantitis. Good daily cleaning prevents this, and it's the single most important thing for long-term implant health.

The survival rate for dental implants at 10 years is over 96%. At 20 years, it's around 90%. These are some of the most reliable outcomes in all of medicine, and they reflect a procedure that's been refined over 60 years of clinical use.

Your implant tooth will be there when you wake up tomorrow, and the day after that, and for decades to come. It's the closest thing in dentistry to turning back time, and the procedure that gets you there, every stage of it, is a lot more straightforward than it sounds.
