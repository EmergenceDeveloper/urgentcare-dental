Here's what you're picturing: a version of that upcoming dental visit where you just... aren't there for it. You close your eyes, dentistry happens, and you wake up on the other side with it finished.

That's the hope behind the question, isn't it? Well, the good news is that version of your dental visit *is* possible. But probably not in the way you're picturing.

Here's something that surprises most people: you don't actually need to be unconscious to not remember or worry about a dental procedure. Instead of the full general anaesthetic that everyone has either heard of or experienced in a hospital, there's something much milder that dental patients with extreme dental anxiety across the world time and time again find "solves" their dreaded dental visits. It's called IV sedation.

IV sedation puts you in a kind of twilight state. You can respond if someone talks to you, you're not "under" in the hospital sense, but afterwards? Most people remember almost nothing. The dentist was there, something was happening, and then it was over and someone was asking if you wanted tea.

It costs around £400 at most private clinics, it doesn't require a hospital, and for a lot of people with dental anxiety, it's the thing that finally makes treatment possible.

## This Is What We Offer at UrgentCare Dental

IV sedation at our Leeds clinic costs £399 per session. That's a flat rate, not an hourly charge that climbs if your procedure runs long.

If you need an extraction and you know sedation is the only way you're getting through it, we offer an [extraction with sedation bundle](/pricing) for £695. That covers the sedation, the extraction, and everything involved.

For something like [wisdom teeth removal](/blog/wisdom-teeth-removal-cost-uk), where the procedure itself is £549 per tooth, adding IV sedation at £399 brings you to just under £950 for the complete experience. One appointment, one recovery period, and no memory of the difficult part.

[Consultations are £20](/contact). You come in, we take a look, we tell you exactly what's happening and exactly what it'll cost. And if sedation is something you want to talk through, that conversation happens then.

## The Difference Between Sedation Options

IV sedation isn't the only option, but it's the deepest form of conscious sedation available in a dental clinic. Here's how the options compare:

**Nitrous oxide** is the lightest touch. You breathe it through a mask, you feel relaxed and a bit floaty, and it wears off within minutes. You can usually drive yourself home. It takes the edge off, but you're fully aware of what's happening.

**Oral sedation** means taking a pill before your appointment. You'll feel drowsy and relaxed, and you might not remember much afterwards. But it takes about an hour to kick in, and the effects last for hours after you leave. You'll need someone to take you home.

**IV sedation** is the deepest level before general anaesthetic. The medication goes directly into your bloodstream through a small needle in your arm or hand. It takes effect within minutes. You're in that twilight state almost immediately, and the dentist can adjust the level throughout the procedure if needed. You'll need someone to collect you, and you won't be making any important decisions for the rest of the day.

For people whose anxiety goes beyond "a bit nervous" into "I physically cannot make myself sit in that chair," IV sedation is usually the one that actually solves the problem.

## What Happens Before, During, and After

Before your appointment, you'll have a consultation where we go through your medical history and make sure sedation is appropriate for you. Most people are fine, but there are some conditions that need consideration.

On the day, you'll want to eat a light meal a couple of hours beforehand. No need to fast like you would for general anaesthetic. Wear comfortable clothes, flat shoes, and skip the nail varnish (the monitoring equipment needs to be able to read through your fingernail).

You'll need someone to bring you and collect you. We won't let you leave alone after IV sedation, and you won't be in any state to get yourself home anyway.

The sedation is administered through a small cannula in your arm or hand. You'll feel it take effect within a minute or two. Then the procedure happens. Then it's done, and you're in recovery until you're ready to go home.

For the rest of that day, you're resting. No driving, no cooking, no looking after children, no signing legal documents, no online shopping (seriously, the amnesic effect plus access to your phone is a combination people have regretted). By the next morning, you'll feel normal again.

## The Cost Question

We've written a full breakdown of [dental sedation costs in the UK](/blog/dental-sedation-costs-uk) if you want the complete picture. The short version: IV sedation typically runs between £300 and £600 at most UK practices, often charged by the hour.

At UrgentCare Dental, it's £399 per session, flat rate. The extraction with sedation bundle at £695 exists because we know that's exactly what a lot of anxious patients need, and bundling it makes the whole thing simpler.

## Is It Worth It?

That depends on what the alternative is.

If you're someone who can get through dental work with a bit of deep breathing and a supportive dentist, you probably don't need sedation. It's an additional cost and it means writing off the rest of your day.

But if you're someone who's been putting off treatment for months or years because you couldn't face it, the calculation changes completely. Sedation isn't a luxury at that point. It's the thing that makes dental care possible.

A filling dealt with now costs less than a root canal later. A root canal costs less than an extraction and an implant. The longer things get left, the more complicated and expensive they become.

If [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options) has been keeping you away from the dentist, sedation might be the thing that breaks the cycle. Not a cure for the anxiety itself, but a way through it. A way to get the treatment done, get your mouth healthy, and maybe start building some less traumatic associations with dental care.

## What Happens Next

If you've been avoiding dental work because you couldn't face being awake for it, now you know: you don't have to be. Not really. Not in the way that matters.

[Book a consultation](/contact) at our Leeds clinic. It's £20, it includes an X-ray, and you'll leave knowing exactly what needs doing and what your options are for getting through it comfortably.

No judgement. Just a conversation about what you need and how we can help you get there.
