You can feel it before you can see it. A heaviness in your cheek, a tightness that wasn't there yesterday. Your jaw feels thick. And when you look in the mirror, one side of your face is visibly larger than the other. Puffy, warm to the touch, with a dull ache radiating from somewhere in your teeth up through your cheekbone.

A toothache is one thing. A swollen face is another thing entirely. The toothache was manageable, annoying, ignorable at times. The swollen face has taken it out of the category of "things I can deal with later" and put it firmly into "this needs sorting now."

The reassuring part: facial swelling from a dental problem is extremely common, highly treatable, and follows a predictable pattern from crisis to resolution. The concerning part: it does mean infection, and infection means the clock is ticking on getting proper treatment.

## What's Causing the Swelling

When a tooth becomes infected, bacteria multiply inside the tooth and spread through the root tip into the surrounding jawbone. The body's immune system responds by sending white blood cells to fight the infection, and the battlefield produces pus: a collection of dead cells, bacteria, and fluid.

That pus needs somewhere to go. It tracks through the bone, into the soft tissue of the gum, and then into the facial tissue. The swelling you're seeing in the mirror is your body's inflammatory response to the infection spreading beyond the tooth into the surrounding structures.

The location of the swelling maps to the source tooth with surprising specificity. Swelling in the upper cheek usually originates from an upper molar or premolar. Swelling under the lower jaw points to a lower molar. Swelling around the eye (periorbital swelling) can come from upper front teeth or canines, where the infection tracks upward through the thin bone of the front face.

The skin over the swelling feels warm because inflammation increases blood flow to the area. It feels tight because the accumulating fluid is stretching the tissue. And the pain often feels diffuse rather than sharp, spreading across the whole side of your face rather than pinpointing a specific tooth, because the infection has moved beyond the tooth itself into a wider area.

## The Severity Spectrum

Facial swelling from dental infection exists on a spectrum, and where your swelling sits on that spectrum determines the urgency.

Mild swelling that's localised around a tooth, slightly puffy gum, maybe a small bump on the gum surface (a fistula, which is the body creating a drainage channel), represents an infection that's contained. It needs treatment, but it's not a crisis. An emergency dental appointment within a day or two is appropriate.

Moderate swelling where the cheek is visibly larger, the area is tender and warm, and you might have a low-grade fever indicates the infection has spread into the facial tissue. This needs an [emergency dental appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk) promptly, ideally the same day. [Antibiotics](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) are almost certainly part of the plan.

Severe swelling with rapid progression, difficulty opening the mouth (trismus), difficulty swallowing, fever above 38°C, or swelling extending to the eye or neck is a medical emergency. Hospital A&E is appropriate alongside emergency dental care. Severe dental infections can, in rare cases, compromise the airway or spread to dangerous anatomical spaces. This outcome is uncommon, but it's why severe, rapidly spreading facial swelling should never be waited out.

The vast majority of dental facial swelling falls into the mild-to-moderate category and responds well to antibiotics and dental treatment within the normal emergency pathway.

## What Happens at the Emergency Appointment

Walking into the dentist with a swollen face, here's the sequence.

The dentist examines the area, both inside the mouth and externally. They're looking at the source tooth, checking for obvious decay, fractures, or failing restorations. They're assessing the extent of the swelling and whether there's a palpable fluctuance (a fluid-filled area under the surface that indicates a drainable collection of pus).

An X-ray shows the tooth root and surrounding bone. A dental [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency) often appears as a dark shadow at the root tip on the X-ray, a halo of bone that's been destroyed by the infection.

If there's a drainable abscess, the dentist may open it. This can happen one of two ways. Through the tooth: drilling into the tooth to access the infected pulp, which releases the pressure from inside and often provides immediate relief. Or through the gum: making a small incision in the swollen tissue to allow the pus to drain. Both approaches are done under local anaesthetic. Neither is as dramatic as it sounds. The relief of draining an abscess is immediate and significant, like releasing the valve on an over-inflated tyre.

Antibiotics are prescribed: [amoxicillin](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) as first-line, or metronidazole for penicillin-allergic patients. Stronger pain relief may be provided if over-the-counter options aren't managing things.

The appointment at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) costs [£20](/pricing). That covers the examination, X-ray, diagnosis, and initial management. For context, emergency appointments at most private practices run £50-£200.

## The Treatment That Prevents It Coming Back

The emergency appointment deals with the acute crisis. The follow-up treatment deals with the cause.

A [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) removes the infected tissue from inside the tooth, sterilises the internal canals, and seals them. The source of infection is eliminated, the tooth is preserved, and a crown protects it long-term. Root canal treatment runs £300-£700, plus £500-£1,000 for the crown.

An [extraction](/blog/emergency-tooth-extraction-costs-uk) removes the tooth entirely. It's definitive: no tooth means no reinfection. Extractions cost £100-£300, or [£549 for a wisdom tooth](/pricing) at UrgentCare Dental.

The choice between saving and removing the tooth depends on how much viable tooth structure remains, how extensive the infection is, and whether the tooth can be effectively restored. Some teeth are worth saving. Others, particularly those with extensive decay or pre-existing damage, are better extracted.

This decision happens after the antibiotics have calmed things down, usually about a week after the emergency appointment. The dentist has a better view of the tooth's condition once the swelling and inflammation have settled.

## Managing the Swelling at Home

Between the emergency appointment and the antibiotics taking full effect, the swelling is at its most frustrating.

Cold compresses help. A wrapped ice pack (or the trusty bag of frozen peas) applied to the outside of the face, 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, reduces blood flow to the area and limits the swelling. This works best in the first 48 hours.

Sleeping propped up on an extra pillow or two reduces blood pressure to the head, which keeps the swelling from worsening overnight. Lying flat allows more blood to pool in the swollen area, which is why the face often looks worse in the morning.

Ibuprofen serves double duty: it's a painkiller and an anti-inflammatory. It directly reduces the swelling while managing the pain. Paracetamol can be added alongside for additional pain relief, as they work on different pathways.

Salt water rinses (a teaspoon of salt in warm water) keep the mouth clean around the infected area and can help draw some fluid from swollen gum tissue. Gentle swishing, not vigorous rinsing.

These measures are management, not treatment. They make the wait for the antibiotics to work more bearable. The antibiotics typically produce noticeable improvement within 24-48 hours, with the swelling visibly reducing by day two or three.

## When the Swelling Doesn't Go Down

In some cases, antibiotics alone don't resolve the swelling, and that's important to recognise.

If the swelling hasn't improved after 48-72 hours of antibiotics, the infection may not be responding to the prescribed antibiotic. A return visit to the dentist is warranted. The antibiotic might be changed, or the abscess might need direct drainage.

If the swelling is getting worse despite antibiotics, that's a signal the infection is progressing faster than the medication can control it. Same-day reassessment by the dentist is important, and if the swelling is severe, A&E may be appropriate.

A hard, board-like swelling that doesn't fluctuate (feel fluid-filled) when pressed can indicate cellulitis, a spreading tissue infection rather than a contained abscess. Cellulitis sometimes needs intravenous antibiotics administered in a hospital setting, particularly if it's in the floor of the mouth or the neck.

These scenarios are the minority. Most dental swelling responds well to oral antibiotics and settles within three to five days. But knowing when the trajectory isn't right prevents a manageable infection from becoming a complicated one.

## The Full Cost Picture

From swollen face to full resolution, here's what the numbers look like.

The emergency appointment: [£20 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), or £50-£200 elsewhere.

Antibiotics: £9.90 per prescription in England (free in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland).

Definitive treatment (one of these):

Root canal to save the tooth: £300-£700, plus crown at £500-£1,000. Total: approximately £830-£1,920 including the emergency appointment and antibiotics.

Extraction to remove the tooth: £100-£300. Total: approximately £130-£530.

Extraction plus future [implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) to replace the tooth: add [£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing). Total: approximately £2,130-£2,530.

The cheapest resolution path (extraction) runs around £130-£300 total. The most expensive (root canal with crown, or extraction with implant) runs £1,500-£2,500. Most people land somewhere in between.

## The Moment the Swelling Goes Down

There's a specific moment, usually on day two or three of antibiotics, when you look in the mirror and your face is yours again. The puffiness has receded. The warmth has faded. Your jaw feels like a jaw rather than a balloon.

The pain drops from a constant presence to an occasional reminder. You can eat on that side again, carefully. You can sleep without waking up from the throbbing. The crisis that felt overwhelming 48 hours ago has become a manageable situation with a clear path to resolution.

That moment of seeing normal proportions in the mirror is surprisingly emotional for people who've been through a few rough days of swelling. The face in the mirror matches the person they know. The infection is retreating. And the path forward, whether that's a root canal to save the tooth or an extraction to remove it, is a calm conversation rather than a panicked emergency.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), seeing someone's face return to normal after a dental infection is one of those daily satisfactions that makes emergency dentistry rewarding. The person who walked in scared and swollen walks out with a plan, a prescription, and the knowledge that the worst part is already over.

And the swelling? It becomes a story. "You should have seen my face last week." That kind of story.
