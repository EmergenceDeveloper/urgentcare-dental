It's 2am. The tooth that was mildly annoying during the day has turned into something else entirely. A deep, throbbing pulse that syncs with your heartbeat, radiating from the jaw into the ear and temple. Paracetamol barely touches it. Ibuprofen helps for an hour, then the throbbing creeps back. Sleep is impossible.

And the thought that keeps circling: why is this happening now? It was manageable this afternoon. Uncomfortable, sure, but not like this. Not this relentless, escalating throb that makes lying down feel like the worst possible position.

The answer is biology. Tooth pain genuinely does get worse at night, and it's not psychological. Several physical mechanisms converge when you lie down in a quiet, dark room, and the result is a predictable amplification of dental pain that turns manageable discomfort into something that feels like an emergency.

## The Blood Pressure Effect

When you lie down, blood redistributes. Standing or sitting during the day, gravity pulls blood toward the lower body. The head and face receive blood at a pressure determined by the heart's pumping against gravity. Lying flat eliminates that gravitational offset. More blood flows to the head. Blood pressure in the vessels around the tooth increases.

Inside an inflamed tooth, the pulp (the nerve and blood vessel bundle in the core of the tooth) is swelling. Inflammation always involves swelling: increased blood flow, fluid accumulation, tissue expansion. During the day, gravity modestly limits how much blood pools in the inflamed area. At night, lying flat, that natural drainage disappears.

The problem is that pulp tissue sits inside a rigid chamber. The tooth is made of dentin and enamel, hard tissues that don't expand. When the inflamed pulp swells inside its unyielding enclosure, the pressure builds with nowhere to go. The nerve fibres within the pulp are compressed by their own swelling tissue, and the signal they send to the brain is: pain.

More blood flow means more swelling. More swelling in a rigid space means more pressure. More pressure means more pain. And lying down delivers that extra blood flow on a schedule: bedtime.

## The Cortisol Drop

Cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone, follows a 24-hour cycle. Levels are highest in the morning, around 6-8am, and lowest at night, typically reaching their trough between midnight and 4am.

Cortisol has a genuine anti-inflammatory effect. Higher cortisol levels during the day actively suppress the inflammatory response, including the inflammation in an infected or damaged tooth. As cortisol drops through the evening and into the night, that suppressive effect diminishes. The inflammation intensifies.

The timing is pointed. Cortisol is lowest at precisely the hours when you're lying down, when blood flow to the head is highest, when distractions are fewest. The biological conditions for maximum tooth pain converge between midnight and 4am, which is exactly when most people with dental pain find themselves staring at the ceiling.

## The Silence Factor

This one isn't biological in the same way, but it's real and it matters.

During the day, the brain manages hundreds of simultaneous inputs: visual information, conversations, tasks, movement, decisions. Pain signals compete for attention with everything else, and the brain's attentional resources are divided. The toothache is present, but it's one signal among many.

At night, in a quiet dark room, the competing inputs vanish. The brain has nothing else to attend to. The pain signal, no longer competing with the noise of daily life, occupies centre stage. The subjective experience of the pain intensifies because it's receiving 100% of the brain's attention instead of 10%.

This is the same mechanism that makes tinnitus worse at night, or makes worries seem insurmountable at 3am when they were manageable at 3pm. The brain amplifies whatever signal is loudest in the absence of competition.

## The Temperature Drop

Body temperature drops slightly during sleep, and the mouth temperature changes with it. For teeth with exposed dentin (from decay, a crack, or gum recession), temperature changes trigger pain. The nerve endings in exposed dentin respond to thermal changes with sharp, shooting pain.

Beyond temperature, the reduced saliva production during sleep concentrates bacteria and acids in the mouth. If there's an active cavity or exposed root surface, the overnight bacterial environment is more aggressive than the daytime one. The tooth is bathing in a slightly more hostile fluid at precisely the time when all the other pain-amplifying factors are also active.

## What the Pain Pattern Tells You

Different types of night-time toothache indicate different problems, and the pattern is diagnostically useful.

**Throbbing pain that matches your heartbeat**, worsens when lying down, and responds poorly to over-the-counter painkillers: this is the signature of irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve that has passed the point of recovery). The nerve is dying. The tooth almost certainly needs a [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) or [extraction](/blog/root-canal-vs-extraction). This is the classic "worst toothache of my life" presentation.

**Deep, constant ache with a swollen face or gum**: this indicates an [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk), an active infection at the root tip. The infection has produced a pocket of pus that puts pressure on surrounding tissue. Night amplifies the pain for all the reasons above, and the swelling may worsen overnight as the inflammatory process continues unmanaged. This needs same-day or [emergency dental treatment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk).

**Sharp pain triggered by cold air or cold water**, lingering for 10+ seconds after the stimulus is removed: this is early pulpitis, where the nerve is inflamed but potentially saveable. The nocturnal pattern is milder, more of a persistent sensitivity than a throb. If caught at this stage, treatment might be a deep filling rather than a root canal.

**Pain when biting or clenching, worse at night**: this can indicate a cracked tooth. The crack opens slightly under biting force and closes again, irritating the nerve. At night, people who [grind their teeth](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) (bruxism) apply sustained clenching force during sleep, aggravating the crack continuously. The morning pain from this is sometimes worse than the bedtime pain.

**Generalised aching in multiple teeth**, worse at night: this is common with bruxism. The jaw muscles clench during sleep, putting sustained force on multiple teeth simultaneously. The resulting pain is muscular and dental, a whole-jaw ache rather than a single-tooth emergency.

## Getting Through the Night

The physiology of night-time toothache suggests some things that help, based on the mechanisms involved.

Propping up with extra pillows reduces blood flow to the head. It's not as effective as standing, but elevating the head 30-45 degrees reduces the blood pooling that intensifies the throb. People with severe toothache often discover this instinctively: they end up sleeping propped up in an armchair or with pillows stacked against the headboard.

Ibuprofen is the most effective over-the-counter option because it's both a painkiller and an anti-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory action directly addresses the swelling that's causing the pressure inside the tooth. 400mg every 6-8 hours, alternated with paracetamol 500mg-1g in between, provides the best coverage. Keeping the doses regular through the night rather than waiting for the pain to return means the anti-inflammatory effect is maintained continuously.

A cold pack on the outside of the cheek (wrapped in a cloth, 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off) constricts blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the inflamed area. It's the external equivalent of elevating the head: reducing the fluid that's driving the pressure.

Distraction works because of the silence factor. A podcast, an audiobook, quiet music: anything that gives the brain competing input reduces the subjective intensity of the pain signal. It doesn't change the biology, but it changes the experience.

## The Morning After

The encouraging part of nocturnal toothache is that the morning often brings genuine relief. Cortisol rises. You sit up and gravity resumes its drainage. Blood pressure in the head normalises. Distractions return. The tooth that was unbearable at 3am becomes manageable at 8am.

This improvement can be dangerously reassuring. The temptation is to think: it's not that bad after all, maybe I don't need to see a dentist. But the pain will return tonight, following the same pattern, and the underlying problem (the infection, the dying nerve, the crack) is progressing regardless of how the morning feels.

A tooth that throbs at night and calms during the day is a tooth that needs attention. The daytime reprieve is physiology giving a temporary break, not the problem resolving itself.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and [same-day treatment](/blog/same-day-emergency-dental-appointments) is available for acute toothache. The assessment includes an X-ray that reveals what's happening inside the tooth, and treatment can begin immediately: [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk), or [antibiotics for an abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk), depending on the diagnosis.

The 2am toothache is one of those experiences that makes the whole world narrow to a single point of pain. The biology behind it is real, predictable, and treatable. Understanding why it happens at night, and knowing that treatment resolves it, makes the gap between the dark hours and the morning appointment a little more bearable.
