The fear is specific. Not a vague unease about dentistry in general, but a sharp, focused dread of those two particular words: root canal. Something about the phrase itself sounds like it should hurt. The word "canal" implies depth. The word "root" implies the very core of something. Put them together and the imagination fills in the rest with images of drilling into the innermost part of a tooth, which, to be fair, is exactly what happens.

Here's the thing, though. The gap between what a root canal sounds like and what it feels like is enormous. Genuinely enormous. The procedure has one of the worst reputations in all of medicine, and the reputation is decades out of date.

## The Procedure Itself: What You Feel

Nothing. Or close to nothing.

Local anaesthetic numbs the tooth and the surrounding area completely before anything begins. The injection itself takes 30 seconds, stings briefly (a sharp pinch in the gum), and then the numbness spreads over the next 2-3 minutes. By the time the dentist starts working, the tooth has no sensation of pain whatsoever.

What remains is pressure. The awareness that instruments are inside the tooth, that something is happening in the jaw. Vibration from the instruments used to clean the canals. A sense of depth, of work being done below the surface. Occasionally, a dull ache that registers as discomfort rather than pain, the deep pressure of files working inside the root.

For most people, the strangest part is the duration. A [root canal on a front tooth](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) takes about an hour. A molar, with its multiple canals, takes 90 minutes to three hours. That's a long time in a dental chair. The mouth gets tired. The jaw gets stiff. The boredom becomes its own kind of challenge.

But pain? The anaesthetic handles that completely.

Surveys of patients who've had root canals consistently report the same finding: the procedure was significantly less painful than they expected. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Endodontics found that patients who had experienced root canal treatment rated the procedure as comparable in discomfort to having a filling placed. The fear beforehand was dramatically worse than the reality.

## The Exception: The Hot Tooth

There is one scenario where achieving complete numbness is more challenging, and it's worth knowing about because understanding it removes the mystery.

A severely infected tooth, one that's been acutely painful for days, is what endodontists call a "hot tooth." The infection changes the chemistry of the surrounding tissue, making it more acidic. Standard anaesthetics work less effectively in acidic environments. The nerve is also firing so aggressively that it takes more anaesthetic to quiet it down.

This doesn't mean the root canal is performed without adequate numbing. It means the dentist uses additional techniques: supplemental injections directly into the ligament around the tooth, intraosseous injection (anaesthetic delivered into the bone itself), or intrapulpal injection (anaesthetic placed directly into the nerve space once it's exposed).

These supplemental techniques work. The dentist has an arsenal of approaches to ensure the tooth is numb before proceeding. If at any point during the procedure the patient feels sharp pain rather than dull pressure, the dentist stops and adds more anaesthetic. The rule is straightforward: the patient should never be in pain during the procedure.

For patients with severe [dental anxiety](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options), [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) removes the experience entirely. Under sedation, the patient is deeply relaxed and amnesic. They won't remember the procedure. The dentist works without interruption, and the patient's experience compresses to: sedation starts, told it's done. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [IV sedation is £399](/pricing) and covers the entire session.

## After the Procedure: The Real Soreness

The numbness wears off 2-4 hours after the procedure. This is when the post-operative soreness arrives, and it's worth setting expectations accurately.

The tooth will be tender. Biting on it directly will produce a deep ache. The gum around the tooth may be sore from the injection sites and from having a rubber dam (the isolation sheet) clamped in place during the procedure. The jaw may be stiff from being open for an extended period.

On a scale that's useful rather than abstract: the discomfort is comparable to having a deep filling, sustained over 2-3 days and then fading. It's an awareness, a sensitivity, a reluctance to chew directly on that tooth. Ibuprofen and paracetamol, alternated, manage it comfortably. Most people don't need anything stronger.

The peak is the evening of the procedure and the following day. By day two, it's noticeably better. By day three or four, the tooth feels essentially normal, just tender if you press on it deliberately. By the end of the first week, the entire episode is a memory.

Eating is possible from day one. Soft food on the treated side for the first day or two, and normal eating on the other side. By day three, most people are eating normally on both sides, just avoiding anything very hard or crunchy directly on the treated tooth.

## The Pain That Was Already There

Here's the perspective that reshapes the whole conversation about root canal pain: the reason someone needs a root canal is almost always because they're already in pain.

The infection inside the tooth, the dying or dead nerve, the abscess forming at the root tip: these are the things that produce the throbbing, radiating, sleep-disrupting, painkiller-resistant agony that sends people to the dentist in the first place. The tooth that's kept someone awake for three nights, the one that throbs in sync with their heartbeat, the one that makes them hold their face and rock gently: that tooth is the one that needs a root canal.

The root canal is what makes it stop.

Not eventually. Not after a long recovery. The relief begins during the procedure itself, when the infected nerve tissue is removed from the canal. The source of the pain is physically taken out of the tooth. By the time the anaesthetic wears off, the post-operative tenderness is a gentler, more manageable sensation than the infection pain that preceded it.

Patients describe this with remarkable consistency: "I expected it to be the worst pain of my life, and instead the worst pain was what I had before the root canal." The procedure resolves the emergency. The recovery is milder than the disease.

## Compared to What?

The comparison that matters is between a root canal and the alternatives.

Compared to a filling: similar or slightly more post-operative discomfort, lasting 2-3 days instead of 1-2. The procedure is longer but no more painful during.

Compared to an [extraction](/blog/root-canal-vs-extraction): the root canal has less post-operative discomfort and a shorter recovery. Extraction recovery involves [3-5 days of soft food](/blog/eating-after-tooth-extraction), swelling, and the risk of [dry socket](/blog/dry-socket-after-tooth-extraction). Root canal recovery involves tenderness but no swelling and no dietary restrictions beyond gentle caution.

Compared to doing nothing: no comparison. An untreated tooth infection gets progressively worse. The pain escalates. The abscess can spread to the surrounding bone, the [face](/blog/swollen-face-toothache), and in rare but serious cases, deeper tissue spaces. "Doing nothing" is not a pain-free option; it's the path to significantly more pain.

## The Fear vs The Reality

[Dental fear](/blog/dental-phobia-help-uk) around root canals is real and valid. It's based on stories, cultural reputation, and the deeply human instinct that anything involving the inside of a tooth must be excruciating.

What the fear isn't based on is current experience. Modern root canals, performed with modern anaesthetics, modern instruments, and modern techniques, are routine procedures that produce mild post-operative discomfort for a few days. The procedure itself is painless. The recovery is manageable. The outcome, a saved tooth and the end of infection pain, is genuinely excellent.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), every [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) includes thorough anaesthesia, with supplemental techniques for hot teeth, and [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) is available for patients who want the procedure to pass without memory. The [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and the assessment includes X-ray imaging that shows exactly what's happening inside the tooth.

The tooth that hurts right now is the problem. The root canal is the solution. And the solution, when it comes to pain, is substantially less eventful than the problem it solves.
