In his Christmas message this year, the King spoke about something simple but meaningful: "getting to know our neighbours and showing respect to one another, creating new friendships."

It struck a chord with us.

We've been so focused on building our practice, on being there when people need us most, that we realised we'd never properly introduced ourselves to the communities around Leeds. We've treated patients from Wakefield and Bradford, from Pudsey and Bingley, from towns across West Yorkshire and beyond. But we'd never actually said hello.

So that's what we're going to do.

## What's Coming Next

Over the coming weeks, we'll be writing little notes to the areas around us. Not sales pitches or service lists. Just... hellos. A wave across the fence, digitally speaking.

Wakefield, Bradford, Pudsey, Bingley, and a few others. We want to introduce ourselves properly to each place, because each one has its own character and its own community, and a generic "we serve West Yorkshire" didn't feel right.

If you're curious about us in the meantime, our [pricing](/pricing) is all on the website. We believe you should know what something costs before you walk through the door.

But this isn't really about any of that. It's simpler than that.

The King was right. Getting to know our neighbours matters. So over the next little while, that's what we're going to do.

Consider this the first hello.

## A Bit About Us

UrgentCare Dental started because something felt broken.

We kept hearing the same stories. Someone's in pain on a Saturday and can't find anyone open. Someone else finally finds an emergency appointment and it's £150 before they've even sat down. People putting off dental work for years because the costs felt impossible, or because they'd had bad experiences and the whole thing just felt too stressful to face.

We thought: it doesn't have to be like this.

So we built something different. Our emergency appointments are [£20](/pricing). We're open seven days a week. When someone calls us in pain, we see them the same day. Not because it's a clever business model, but because that's just how it should work.

Dr. Zain Chishty leads our clinical team from our flagship location at Whitehall Estate in Armley. He's the kind of dentist who'll actually explain what's going on in your mouth, what your options are, and what things cost before anything happens. No surprises, no pressure.

## What We're Actually Like

We do all the things you'd expect a dental practice to do. Check-ups, cleanings, fillings, crowns, extractions. [Teeth whitening](/services/cosmetic-dentistry) and [composite bonding](/services/cosmetic-dentistry) for people who want to feel better about their smile. [Clear aligners](/services/orthodontics) for straightening. The full range, really.

But the thing we hear most from patients isn't about any particular treatment. It's that they felt listened to. That nobody made them feel judged for how long it had been since their last appointment. That the whole experience was just... calmer than they expected.

We've also built a [smile preview tool](/smile-preview) that we're quite proud of. You upload a photo, and you can see what cosmetic work might look like on you. No commitment, no appointment needed. Just a way to picture the possibility before you decide anything.

## Come Say Hello

That's us. A small team in Armley who believe dental care should be accessible, affordable, and a lot less stressful than it usually is.

If you're ever in the area, or if you just need someone to talk to about what's going on with your teeth, the door's always open. No judgement, no pressure. Just a cup of tea and an honest conversation.

We're looking forward to getting to know our neighbours. And we hope, in time, you'll think of us as good ones.
