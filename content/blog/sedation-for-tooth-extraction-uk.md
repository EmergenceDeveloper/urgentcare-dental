There's a specific type of dread that belongs to tooth extractions. It's different from other dental fears because it's so concrete. A tooth is going to be removed from your jaw. You can picture it. You can almost feel it. And that mental image, of pressure and cracking and something being pulled from bone, is vivid enough to cancel appointments, postpone decisions, and keep people awake at night running through scenarios they've constructed entirely from imagination.

Here's the thing about that mental image: it's wrong. Almost completely wrong. Modern extractions are nothing like what your brain is conjuring up. But telling someone that doesn't fix the fear. Information doesn't override anxiety. The body doesn't care that logically, rationally, the procedure is routine and painless. The body is scared, and the body runs the show.

Which is exactly why sedation exists. And why it changes everything for people who've been stuck in that loop of knowing they need a tooth out but being unable to make themselves go through with it.

## The Three Levels

Sedation for dental work comes in three distinct forms, and they differ in ways that really matter. Understanding the differences is the key to finding the right one.

Inhalation sedation, widely known as happy gas, is the mildest option. A small mask sits over your nose, and you breathe a carefully controlled mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Within a few minutes, the world softens. The edges come off everything. You're still completely aware of what's happening, you can hear the dentist, you can respond to questions, you can feel things. But the anxiety fades to a background hum that you can observe without being controlled by it.

The beauty of nitrous oxide is the control. The dentist adjusts the concentration in real time, dialling it up if you need more and down when the critical part is done. And when the mask comes off, the effect clears within minutes. Five minutes later, you feel completely normal. No grogginess, no lingering effects, no need for someone to drive you home.

Inhalation sedation costs £75-£150 per session at most UK practices. For mild to moderate anxiety, it works brilliantly. For deep-seated dental phobia, it sometimes isn't enough.

Oral sedation sits in the middle ground. You take a tablet, usually diazepam (Valium), about an hour before your appointment. By the time you're in the chair, you feel deeply relaxed. Calmer than you've felt in weeks, probably. The world has a pleasant softness to it, and while you're aware of the procedure, you're watching it from a comfortable emotional distance.

Oral sedation costs £75-£200. You'll need someone to drive you home, and you'll feel drowsy for the rest of the day. The memory of the procedure tends to stay largely intact, which is a meaningful difference from the next option. For moderate anxiety, oral sedation works well. It takes the fear from a 9 down to a 3, and for a lot of people, that's enough.

And then there's [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like). A cannula goes into the back of your hand, the sedation medication flows in, and within about 30 seconds something quite remarkable happens. A wave of calm, deep and genuine, washes through you. The anxiety dissolves. The tension in your body releases. You're still conscious, still breathing on your own, still able to respond to the dentist. But the part of your brain that generates fear has been gently switched off.

The defining feature of IV sedation is the amnesia. Midazolam, the drug most commonly used, prevents new memories from forming during the procedure. You go from feeling that wave of calm to being told everything's finished, and the bit in between simply doesn't exist in your memory. It wasn't suppressed or blurred. The memory was never created.

IV sedation at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) costs [£399](/pricing). At most UK practices, it runs £350-£500. For someone who's been avoiding an extraction for months or years because of [genuine fear](/blog/dental-phobia-help-uk), that £399 is the thing that finally makes it possible.

## The Combined Cost

Sedation is an addition to the cost of the extraction itself, so the total bill is both together.

A straightforward tooth extraction at a private dentist runs £100-£300 depending on the tooth and the complexity. [Wisdom teeth](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) cost more because of their position: £200-£600 per tooth.

At UrgentCare Dental, a [wisdom tooth extraction with sedation](/pricing) is offered as a combined package at £695, which covers both the extraction and the IV sedation together. That's notably less than paying for each separately at many practices.

For a standard extraction with IV sedation elsewhere in the UK, the combined cost typically falls between £450-£800. With inhalation sedation, it's more like £175-£450 total. With oral sedation, £175-£500.

Here's how that looks laid out clearly:

A simple extraction with no sedation (just local anaesthetic) runs £100-£300. The same extraction with happy gas adds £75-£150 to that total. With oral sedation, add £75-£200. And with IV sedation, add £350-£500, or £399 at UrgentCare Dental.

The wisdom tooth version follows the same pattern but at a higher base cost. A wisdom tooth extraction with IV sedation at a typical UK practice runs £550-£1,100. UrgentCare Dental's combined [£695 package](/pricing) sits at the more accessible end of that range.

## What Extraction Under Sedation Actually Feels Like

With IV sedation, the honest answer is: nothing. You feel the wave of calm, and then you're told it's done. The experience between those two points simply doesn't register.

But what's actually happening during that gap is worth describing, because understanding it takes even more of the unknown out of the equation.

You're sitting in the dental chair, relaxed and calm. The dentist applies local anaesthetic to the area around the tooth. Under IV sedation, you barely register this happening. The local anaesthetic means the area is completely numb; the sedation means you don't care about the process of getting there.

The dentist uses an instrument called an elevator to gently rock the tooth in its socket, gradually loosening the periodontal ligament fibres that hold it in place. This takes a few minutes. Then forceps grip the tooth and ease it out. There's no cracking, no wrenching. The tooth yields and lifts free. The socket gets checked, possibly stitched if needed, and gauze goes over the site.

Under IV sedation, you're cooperative throughout this process. If the dentist asks you to open wider, you do. If they need you to turn your head slightly, you comply. You're in a twilight state: conscious enough to respond, detached enough that nothing registers as distressing. And afterwards, none of it exists in your memory.

With inhalation sedation, you're more aware. You'll feel pressure (never pain, that's the local anaesthetic's job), you'll hear the instruments, you'll know what's happening. But the anxiety that would normally accompany those sensations is muted. You're watching the experience from behind a comfortable cushion of calm.

With oral sedation, the experience sits between these two. You're aware, but relaxed. The memory tends to stick around, though it's often softer and less vivid than you'd expect.

## Multiple Extractions: Where Sedation Shines

Something that makes sedation particularly valuable: it allows the dentist to do more work in a single visit.

A patient who needs three teeth extracted might face three separate appointments, each with its own build-up of anxiety, its own sleepless night before, its own white-knuckle grip on the armrests. Under IV sedation, all three extractions happen in one session. One round of anxiety management. One recovery period. One and done.

For someone who's been [avoiding the dentist for years](/blog/dental-anxiety-treatment-options) and has accumulated a backlog of work, this is transformative. Multiple extractions, fillings, even a clean, all in one session under sedation. The practical efficiency of combining everything into a single visit is matched by the emotional relief of knowing you only have to go through the experience once.

At UrgentCare Dental, patients regularly have multiple procedures completed under a single round of IV sedation. The sedation fee is per session, not per procedure, which means combining treatments under one sedation appointment is genuinely cost-effective as well as emotionally easier.

## The Safety Question

IV sedation has an excellent safety profile for dental procedures. It's been used in UK dentistry for decades, and the monitoring is thorough.

Throughout the procedure, a pulse oximeter clips onto your finger measuring blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The dentist has completed specific training in sedation delivery and emergency protocols. The drugs are titrated, meaning they're given gradually in small doses until the right level of sedation is achieved, rather than delivering one large dose.

There are a few things that affect eligibility for IV sedation. Certain medical conditions (uncontrolled heart conditions, some respiratory disorders) need to be discussed. Some medications interact with sedation drugs. Pregnancy is a contraindication. And a high BMI can affect how the drugs are metabolised, which the dentist needs to account for in dosing.

The consultation before a sedation appointment covers all of this. It's a thorough conversation about medical history, current medications, and any concerns, and it's the point where the dentist determines which type of sedation is appropriate.

The practical requirements after IV sedation are straightforward: someone needs to take you home (no driving for 24 hours), and you shouldn't make any important decisions or operate machinery for the rest of the day. Most people spend the afternoon on the sofa feeling pleasantly sleepy, and by the following morning they feel completely normal.

## The Emotional Arithmetic

There's a calculation that happens in people's heads when they think about sedation for an extraction, and it usually sounds something like: "Is it really worth paying an extra few hundred pounds just because I'm scared?"

That framing undersells what sedation actually does. It's not paying extra because you're scared. It's paying for the thing that makes the treatment happen at all.

The person who's been putting off an extraction for two years because of anxiety isn't choosing between "extraction" and "extraction with sedation." They're choosing between "extraction with sedation" and "no extraction." And no extraction means the problem gets worse. A tooth that needs extracting today needs extracting even more urgently in six months, and by then there might be infection, bone loss, damage to neighbouring teeth, and a bill that's grown significantly.

The sedation fee is the cost of breaking the cycle. It's what turns an impossible situation into a manageable one. And the patients who come out the other side of their first sedation appointment, the ones who look faintly amazed that it's already over and they can't remember any of it, those patients don't question the value for a second.

## The Appointment That Changes the Pattern

There's a moment that happens after a sedation extraction that deserves its own paragraph.

It usually happens the next morning. The sedation has fully cleared, the socket is tender but manageable, and the overwhelming feeling is: relief. Not just physical relief that the problematic tooth is gone, but a deeper, quieter relief. The thing you'd been dreading has happened, and it was nothing. You can't even remember it.

That moment rewrites the relationship with dentistry for a lot of people. The dentist stops being the place of white-knuckle terror and becomes the place where problems get solved, comfortably, efficiently, and without the experience you'd been dreading. Future appointments feel different. The avoidance pattern breaks.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), we see this shift constantly. Someone comes in for a sedation extraction having avoided dentistry for years. They leave wondering why they waited. And six months later, they're back for a routine check-up, sitting in the chair without needing sedation at all. That progression, from phobia to comfort, is one of the most rewarding things in dental practice.

The extraction was the immediate problem. The sedation was how it became possible. And the confidence that comes afterwards? That's the thing that lasts.
