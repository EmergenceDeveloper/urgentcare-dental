The pain was building for days. A deep, relentless throb centred on one tooth, [worse at night](/blog/toothache-at-night), barely touched by painkillers, accompanied by a swelling on the gum that grew from a small bump to something you could feel with your tongue, hot and tight and pressurised.

And then it burst. A sudden release, a rush of foul-tasting fluid into the mouth, warm and salty and utterly disgusting. And almost immediately, spectacularly: relief. The pressure that had been building for days dropped. The throbbing eased. The swelling began to subside. The world, which had narrowed to a single point of dental agony, expanded again.

The temptation, in that wave of relief, is to think the problem has resolved itself. The body handled it. The abscess drained. The infection is gone.

It isn't. And this is the important part.

## What Just Happened

A dental [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) is a pocket of pus: a collection of dead white blood cells, bacteria, and tissue fluid that forms at the tip of an infected tooth root. The infection inside the tooth produces bacteria that escape through the root tip into the surrounding bone. The body's immune response kills bacteria and creates pus. The pus accumulates, forming a pressurised pocket.

When the abscess bursts, that pressurised pocket has found an exit. The pus drains through a pathway (called a sinus tract or fistula) that the pressure has created through the bone and gum tissue. The fluid empties into the mouth, and the pressure drops.

This drainage is the body's safety valve. It prevents the pressure from building to the point where the infection [spreads into deeper tissue spaces](/blog/tooth-infection-spreading-signs). In that sense, the burst abscess is the body handling a dangerous situation intelligently.

But the drainage addresses the pressure, not the source. The source of the infection is inside the tooth: dead, infected pulp tissue in the root canal system. The bacteria continue living in the tooth. The sinus tract remains open, periodically draining pus. The infection becomes chronic rather than acute: less painful, less dramatic, but ongoing.

## The Sinus Tract

After the initial burst, many abscesses establish a permanent drainage pathway. A small bump on the gum, often described as a "gum boil" or "pimple," appears near the tip of the affected tooth's root. This bump is the opening of the sinus tract.

The sinus tract acts as a pressure release valve. Pus drains slowly through it, preventing the buildup that caused the acute pain. The bump may come and go: swelling slightly when pus accumulates, then deflating when it drains. Pressing on it may produce a discharge of salty, unpleasant-tasting fluid.

Some patients live with a draining sinus tract for months or years, tolerating the intermittent discharge because the acute pain of the original abscess hasn't returned. The absence of severe pain creates a dangerous false reassurance: the infection isn't gone, it's just managed by continuous drainage.

During this time, the infection at the root tip continues to destroy bone. The X-ray shows a progressively enlarging dark area around the root: a zone of bone that's been dissolved by the chronic infection. This bone loss doesn't produce symptoms, but it reduces the tooth's support and can compromise the bone available for future [implant placement](/blog/dental-bone-loss-treatment-uk) or affect neighbouring teeth.

## What the Taste and Smell Mean

The fluid from a burst abscess tastes foul: a combination of metallic, salty, and putrid. The smell is similarly unpleasant. Both reflect the contents of the abscess: dead tissue, bacterial byproducts, and the chemical products of immune cell destruction.

After the initial burst, the drainage may be intermittent. A bad taste that comes and goes, particularly noticeable in the morning (overnight accumulation), is a sign of ongoing drainage from a chronic sinus tract.

Some patients notice the bad taste when pressing on the gum near a specific tooth. This reproducible drainage on pressure is diagnostically helpful: it identifies the tooth that's the source of the infection.

## Why You Still Need Treatment

The tooth that caused the abscess is still infected. The bacteria are still inside the root canal system. The sinus tract is an exit for pus, not a cure for infection.

Without treatment, the infection continues indefinitely. The chronic bone destruction progresses. The risk of [acute flare-ups](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) remains: the sinus tract can become blocked, pressure rebuilds, and the acute pain returns. The cycle of build-up, burst, relief, build-up repeats.

More seriously, a chronic dental infection represents a constant bacterial load that the immune system must continuously manage. In patients with certain medical conditions (heart valve problems, joint replacements, compromised immune systems), this chronic infection can seed bacteria into the bloodstream, creating risks that extend well beyond the mouth.

The definitive treatments are the same whether the abscess has burst or not:

**[Root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk)** removes the infected pulp tissue from inside the tooth, cleans and disinfects the canal system, and seals it. The source of infection is eliminated. The sinus tract closes on its own within 1-2 weeks of successful root canal treatment, because there's no longer any infection producing pus. The bone at the root tip gradually regenerates. Cost: £600-£1,400, depending on the tooth.

**[Extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk)** removes the tooth and the infection with it. The socket heals, the bone regenerates, and the infection is permanently resolved. Cost: £100-£600. The gap is then addressed with an [implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk), [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), or [denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk).

[Antibiotics alone](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) don't cure a dental abscess. They suppress the bacterial population temporarily, reducing symptoms, but the bacteria in the tooth are protected from antibiotics by the dead tissue environment of the root canal. When the antibiotics finish, the surviving bacteria repopulate and the infection returns.

## What to Do Right Now

After an abscess has burst, the immediate situation is manageable while you arrange dental treatment.

Rinse gently with warm salt water (half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water) to clean the area and encourage drainage. The salt water isn't treating the infection; it's reducing bacterial load at the drainage site and keeping the area clean.

Continue with over-the-counter pain management: ibuprofen 400mg every 6-8 hours (anti-inflammatory, which addresses the residual inflammation) and paracetamol 500mg-1g alternated between ibuprofen doses.

Don't try to squeeze or press the abscess to force more drainage. The sinus tract will drain at its own pace. Excessive pressure can push bacteria deeper into the tissue rather than out through the tract.

Book a dental appointment as soon as possible. This isn't a wait-and-see situation: the infection is active, the tooth needs treatment, and delaying only allows more bone destruction and risks a recurrence of the acute episode.

## The Dental Appointment

The assessment is straightforward. The dentist examines the tooth, takes an X-ray that shows the abscess at the root tip (a dark shadow around the end of the root), and confirms the diagnosis.

If the tooth is saveable (enough structure remaining, the root isn't fractured, the [prognosis for root canal](/blog/root-canal-longevity) is good), root canal treatment is recommended. This may begin at the same appointment or be scheduled for a dedicated session.

If the tooth is beyond saving (extensive decay, root fracture, severe bone loss), [extraction](/blog/extracting-infected-tooth-uk) is the recommendation. For patients who are anxious about the procedure, [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like) covers the entire treatment session.

In some cases, the dentist may prescribe a course of antibiotics before definitive treatment to reduce the acute infection. This isn't a substitute for treatment: it's preparation for treatment, reducing the bacterial load before the tooth is opened or extracted.

## The Relief That Follows Treatment

Root canal treatment on an abscessed tooth often provides dramatic pain relief, similar to the relief from the abscess bursting, but permanent. The source of infection is removed from inside the tooth. The sinus tract closes within days. The bone begins healing within weeks. The chronic bad taste disappears. The gum bump flattens and vanishes.

Patients who've been living with a draining abscess for months describe the post-root-canal experience as a revelation: the low-level awareness of something wrong, the intermittent taste, the gum bump that came and went, all of it resolved. The tooth is quiet. The infection is gone.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing) and includes X-ray and assessment. [Same-day treatment](/blog/same-day-emergency-dental-appointments) is available for [dental abscesses](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk), including both [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) and [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk). [IV sedation at £399](/pricing) is available for patients who prefer it.

The burst abscess provided relief. Treatment provides resolution. The difference is the difference between managing a problem and ending it.
