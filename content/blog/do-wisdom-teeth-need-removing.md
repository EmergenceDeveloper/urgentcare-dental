Someone's mentioned your wisdom teeth. Maybe the dentist pointed them out on an X-ray, or a friend just had theirs out and now you're wondering about your own. And the question that follows is deceptively simple: do mine need to come out?

The answer depends entirely on what your specific wisdom teeth are doing. And the range of possibilities is wider than most people realise: from "they absolutely need to come out and here's why" to "they're perfectly fine and there's no reason to touch them." About 30% of people have wisdom teeth that come through completely, sit in the right position, and never cause a single problem. Those teeth are as useful as any other molar. Removing them would be unnecessary surgery.

The other 70%? That's where the conversation gets specific.

## When the Answer Is Yes

There are situations where wisdom tooth removal is clearly the right call, and the clinical evidence for extraction is strong.

**Recurrent [pericoronitis](/blog/pericoronitis-treatment-uk)** is the most common reason. If the gum over a partially erupted wisdom tooth has become infected more than once, the pattern is established: the anatomy creates a trap for bacteria, and antibiotics fix the symptom without changing the anatomy. Each recurrence costs time, money, and misery. Extraction ends the cycle.

**Damage to neighbouring teeth** is the strongest argument for preventive removal. An [impacted wisdom tooth](/blog/impacted-wisdom-teeth-uk) pushing against the second molar can cause decay on the neighbouring tooth's back surface, a cavity that's almost impossible to treat while the wisdom tooth is in the way. The X-ray shows this clearly: the impacted tooth pressed against its neighbour, a dark shadow of decay forming at the contact point. Removing the wisdom tooth saves the molar, which is a far more important tooth for chewing.

**Decay in the wisdom tooth itself** often makes extraction the better option over filling. Wisdom teeth sit so far back that filling them properly is technically challenging, and the restoration is difficult to maintain with normal brushing. A wisdom tooth with significant decay is usually better removed than patched.

**Cyst formation** around an impacted wisdom tooth is uncommon but significant. The follicular sac that surrounds an unerupted tooth can develop into a cyst, a fluid-filled cavity that expands into the surrounding bone. Cysts are typically painless and discovered on routine X-rays. They're treated by removing both the cyst and the tooth, and early removal prevents the cyst from growing large enough to compromise significant bone volume.

**Orthodontic reasons** sometimes come into play. If [orthodontic treatment](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) is planned or underway, wisdom teeth that might push other teeth out of alignment as they try to erupt may need removing to protect the investment in straightening.

## When the Answer Is No (Or Not Yet)

Just as clearly, there are situations where wisdom teeth should be left alone.

**Fully erupted, well-positioned, and symptom-free** wisdom teeth that function normally as part of the dental arch are teeth worth keeping. They contribute to chewing, they have opposing teeth to bite against, and they cause no problems. Removing a functional tooth for no clinical reason makes no sense.

**Deeply impacted teeth with no symptoms and no pathology** can be monitored rather than removed. A wisdom tooth buried deep in the bone, vertically oriented, showing no signs of cyst formation, and not pressing on anything may sit quietly for an entire lifetime. Annual X-rays confirm nothing's changing, and as long as the picture stays stable, the tooth stays put.

**Medical risk factors** that make surgery inadvisable can tip the balance toward monitoring. Patients with significant medical conditions, those on certain medications (particularly blood thinners or bisphosphonates), or elderly patients where the surgical risks outweigh the benefits of preventive removal, fall into this category.

**The tooth is too close to the nerve** for safe extraction without specialist techniques. In some cases, the roots of lower wisdom teeth wrap around or sit directly adjacent to the inferior alveolar nerve. Standard extraction carries a risk of nerve damage in these cases. The dentist may recommend monitoring rather than removal, or referral to an oral surgeon with specific experience in nerve-adjacent extractions.

## The Grey Zone

Most wisdom tooth decisions don't sit at the extremes. They sit in the middle, where the tooth isn't causing problems right now but might in the future, and the question becomes one of probability rather than certainty.

The factors that inform this decision are specific to each tooth:

**Angle of impaction** matters. Mesioangular impactions (tilted forward toward the neighbouring molar) are the most likely to cause future problems. Vertical impactions (pointing straight up or down) are the least likely to cause issues if they're not currently symptomatic.

**Age** is a significant factor. Younger patients (late teens to mid-twenties) have softer bone, less developed roots, and faster healing. Extracting a wisdom tooth at 19 is a simpler procedure with easier recovery than extracting the same tooth at 45. The surgical difficulty and complication risk increase with age, which is one argument for earlier intervention when the probability of future problems is moderate to high.

**Root development** matters. A wisdom tooth with incomplete root formation is easier to remove and has a lower risk of nerve proximity issues. Once the roots are fully formed, they're longer, more curved, and potentially closer to the nerve canal.

**Gum tissue** around the tooth provides clues. A partially erupted tooth with a persistent gum flap is likely to develop [pericoronitis](/blog/pericoronitis-treatment-uk) at some point. The pocket is there, the bacteria will eventually exploit it. It's a question of when, not if.

## What the Dentist Is Looking At

The conversation about wisdom teeth should happen with an X-ray on the screen, because the visual evidence is what makes the recommendation concrete rather than abstract.

The dentist points to the wisdom tooth and shows you:

The angle. Is it straight, tilted, or horizontal? The angle predicts the likelihood of future problems and the complexity of extraction.

The relationship to the neighbouring tooth. Is the wisdom tooth pressing against the molar in front? Is there space between them, or are they in contact? Contact points are where decay develops.

The depth. Is the tooth partially through, fully through, or still completely under the gum? Depth affects both the likelihood of symptoms and the complexity of removal.

The nerve. In the lower jaw, the inferior alveolar nerve canal runs through the bone below the tooth roots. The X-ray shows how close the wisdom tooth roots are to this canal. If they're intimate, a CT scan provides a three-dimensional view to plan the extraction safely.

The bone around the tooth. Any dark shadows around the tooth on the X-ray might indicate cyst formation or infection. These findings strengthen the case for removal.

This visual conversation turns "do my wisdom teeth need removing?" from an abstract question into a specific one about specific teeth with specific anatomy.

## The Cost of Each Path

**Monitoring** costs a dental check-up and X-ray annually: £50-£120 per year at most practices. This is the ongoing cost of keeping an eye on wisdom teeth that are currently asymptomatic.

**Extraction** costs [£549 per wisdom tooth at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), or £200-£600 per tooth across the UK. With [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk), the combined package at UrgentCare Dental is [£695](/pricing).

**Managing recurrent problems** without extraction costs an [emergency appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk) ([£20 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing)) plus antibiotics (£9.90) per episode. Three episodes over two years: approximately £90 in direct costs, plus the indirect costs of pain, missed work, and disrupted life.

The financial case for extraction is clearest when problems are recurring: the single cost of extraction versus the cumulative cost of repeated emergency management. For asymptomatic teeth being monitored, the annual check-up cost is modest and the "wait and see" approach is genuinely reasonable.

## Making the Decision

The decision about wisdom teeth removal is always made together with the dentist, and a good dentist will explain their reasoning clearly.

If the recommendation is removal: why? What does the X-ray show? What's the risk of leaving the tooth? What's the expected complexity of the extraction?

If the recommendation is monitoring: what are they watching for? How often should X-rays be taken? What symptoms should prompt a reassessment?

If the recommendation is uncertain: what factors point toward removal, what factors point toward leaving it, and what would tip the balance either way?

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the wisdom tooth assessment includes X-ray imaging and a thorough conversation about whether removal is recommended, why or why not, and what the alternatives look like. The decision is yours, informed by the clinical evidence and the dentist's experience.

Some wisdom teeth clearly need to come out. Some clearly don't. And for the ones in between, the answer isn't "yes" or "no." It's "let's look at what your teeth are actually doing, and make the decision that fits your specific situation."

That's the conversation worth having. And it starts with an X-ray and an honest discussion.
