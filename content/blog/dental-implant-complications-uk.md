[Dental implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) have a success rate of 95-97%. That's an excellent number, and it's the number that matters most. But that 3-5% represents real patients with real complications, and understanding what can go wrong, how to recognise it, and what the solutions look like, turns the implant journey from blind trust into informed ownership.

The reassuring context: most implant complications are treatable. They add time, cost, and inconvenience, but they rarely result in permanent problems. The implant that fails can be replaced. The infection that develops can be treated. The bone loss that begins can be managed. Knowing the landscape of potential issues is protective, not alarming.

## Early Complications (First 3 Months)

### Implant Failure

Early failure occurs when the implant doesn't achieve osseointegration: the process of bone fusing to the titanium surface. Instead of integrating, the implant remains surrounded by fibrous tissue and never becomes stable.

Incidence: 2-4% of implants. The risk is higher in smokers, in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, in the posterior maxilla (upper back jaw, where bone is softer), and when implants are placed into compromised bone.

Signs: the implant feels loose when tested. There may be pain or discomfort at the site. The implant may spin or move when pressure is applied. X-rays show a dark halo around the implant rather than the white line of healthy bone contact.

Treatment: the failed implant is removed (a simple procedure, because the implant isn't attached to anything). The site heals for 2-3 months, and a new implant is placed. Bone grafting may be needed if the original site has lost volume. Many practices, including UrgentCare Dental, include implant replacement in their treatment guarantee.

### Infection

Post-surgical infection at the implant site occurs in 2-3% of cases. Bacteria from the mouth contaminate the surgical site, and the infection develops in the gum and bone around the implant.

Signs: increasing pain after the first week (rather than the normal [decrease](/blog/dental-implant-pain)), swelling that worsens rather than resolves, redness, pus discharge from around the implant, and fever.

Treatment: antibiotics (oral or IV, depending on severity) and possibly surgical debridement (cleaning the infected area). If the infection is caught early, the implant can often be saved. If the infection has compromised osseointegration, the implant may need removal.

Prevention: pre-operative antibiotics (a single dose before surgery), meticulous surgical technique, and good post-operative hygiene reduce infection risk. Smoking cessation before surgery is strongly recommended: smokers have infection rates 3-4 times higher than non-smokers.

### Nerve Damage

Lower jaw implants sit near the inferior alveolar nerve, which runs through the mandible and provides sensation to the lower lip, chin, and gums. If the implant is placed too close to or into this nerve canal, nerve damage can result.

Incidence: 0.5-5% of lower jaw implants, depending on the tooth position and the surgeon's experience. The risk is highest for implants replacing lower premolars and molars.

Signs: numbness, tingling, or altered sensation in the lower lip, chin, or tongue on the implant side. The sensation may appear immediately after surgery (when the anaesthetic wears off and the numbness persists) or develop over days.

Outcome: most nerve injuries from implant placement are temporary, resolving over weeks to months as the nerve heals. Permanent nerve damage occurs in less than 1% of cases. If the implant is compressing the nerve, early removal (within days) gives the best chance of full recovery.

Prevention: CT scan imaging before surgery shows the precise location of the nerve canal relative to the planned implant position. Experienced implant surgeons maintain a safety margin of at least 2mm between the implant tip and the nerve canal.

### Sinus Perforation

Upper jaw implants in the molar region sit near the maxillary sinus. If the implant penetrates through the bone into the sinus cavity, a sinus perforation occurs.

Incidence: 1-3% of upper posterior implants, though the clinical significance varies. A small perforation (1-2mm) often heals spontaneously. A larger perforation may require repair.

Signs: nasal congestion on the implant side, a feeling of air passing through the implant site when blowing the nose, or sinus infection symptoms (pain, pressure, discharge) in the weeks after surgery.

Treatment: small perforations typically heal on their own with antibiotic coverage. Larger perforations may require surgical closure. In some cases, the implant needs to be removed if the sinus infection doesn't resolve. [Sinus lift procedures](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) performed before or during implant placement reduce this risk by building bone height below the sinus.

## Late Complications (After Osseointegration)

### Peri-Implantitis

The most significant long-term complication. Peri-implantitis is essentially [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) around an implant: bacterial infection of the tissue surrounding the implant, progressing to bone loss around the implant body.

Incidence: 10-20% of implants over 10 years. This is the number that looks most alarming, but context matters: most peri-implantitis is detectable and treatable before it threatens the implant.

Signs: bleeding when probing around the implant. Redness and swelling of the gum tissue. Deepening of the pocket around the implant (measured at check-up appointments). Pus discharge in advanced cases. Bone loss visible on X-rays. The implant itself remains stable until the bone loss becomes severe.

Treatment depends on severity:

**Early peri-implant mucositis** (inflammation without bone loss) is treated with professional cleaning, improved home care, and antimicrobial rinses. This is reversible if caught early. Cost: included in routine hygiene appointments.

**Moderate peri-implantitis** (some bone loss) requires more aggressive treatment: surgical access to clean the implant surface, decontamination of the implant threads with specialised techniques (lasers, air polishing, chemical decontamination), and bone grafting around the implant to regenerate lost bone. Cost: £500-£1,500 per implant.

**Severe peri-implantitis** (significant bone loss, implant mobility) may require implant removal. The site heals, bone grafting rebuilds the defect, and a new implant is placed after healing. Cost: the combined cost of removal, grafting, and reimplantation.

Prevention: regular dental check-ups with probing around the implant (every 6 months). Professional cleaning around the implant. Good daily oral hygiene. Smoking cessation (smokers have peri-implantitis rates 2-3 times higher than non-smokers). Management of diabetes (poorly controlled diabetes increases risk).

### Screw Loosening

The implant system has multiple components: the implant body (in the bone), the abutment (connector piece), and the crown. These components are connected by screws that can loosen over time with repetitive loading.

Incidence: 5-10% of implants over 10 years. This is a mechanical issue rather than a biological one.

Signs: the crown feels slightly loose or wobbles. A clicking sensation when biting. In severe cases, the crown comes off entirely.

Treatment: the crown is removed, the screw is retightened to the specified torque, and the crown is recemented. This is a 15-30 minute appointment. Cost: £50-£200. If the screw has fractured (rare), it needs to be retrieved with specialised instruments, which is more complex and costly.

### Crown Fracture

The ceramic crown on top of the implant can chip or fracture, the same way a [crown on a natural tooth](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) can.

Incidence: 5-8% of implant crowns over 10 years, higher in patients who [grind their teeth](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions).

Treatment: small chips can be polished. Moderate chips can be repaired with composite. Crowns with significant fractures are replaced. Cost: £50-£200 for repair, £400-£650 for replacement.

## The Risk Factors

**Smoking** is the most significant controllable risk factor. Smokers have double the implant failure rate and 2-3 times the peri-implantitis rate of non-smokers. Quitting (or at minimum, stopping for 2 weeks before and 8 weeks after surgery) substantially reduces the risk.

**Uncontrolled diabetes** impairs healing and increases infection risk. HbA1c levels above 8% are associated with higher complication rates. Good glycaemic control before and after implant surgery improves outcomes significantly.

**[Teeth grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions)** subjects implants to excessive forces that stress the components and the bone. A night guard protects the implant and its crown from bruxism-related damage.

**Poor oral hygiene** promotes peri-implantitis. An implant needs the same (arguably more) diligent cleaning as a natural tooth. Neglecting oral hygiene around an implant invites the bacterial infection that leads to bone loss.

**Insufficient bone** at the implant site increases the risk of early failure. [Bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) before or during implant placement addresses this risk.

## The Cost of Complications

| Complication | Incidence | Treatment Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early failure + replacement | 2-4% | Often covered by guarantee |
| Post-operative infection | 2-3% | £100-£300 (antibiotics + review) |
| Nerve damage (temporary) | 0.5-5% | Monitoring (no direct cost) |
| Peri-implant mucositis | 30-40% | Included in hygiene visits |
| Peri-implantitis (treatment) | 10-20% | £500-£1,500 |
| Screw loosening | 5-10% | £50-£200 |
| Crown fracture | 5-8% | £50-£650 |
| Implant removal + replacement | 3-5% | £2,000-£4,000 |

Most complications fall in the £50-£300 range: adjustments, retightening, minor repairs. The serious complications (peri-implantitis treatment, implant replacement) are less common and more costly, but they're managed within the same implant treatment pathway.

## Monitoring and Prevention

The single most effective prevention strategy for implant complications is regular monitoring. Dental check-ups every 6 months include:

Probing around each implant to measure pocket depth and check for bleeding. X-rays at regular intervals (annually or as indicated) to monitor bone levels. Assessment of the crown and screw components for stability. Professional cleaning around the implant.

Early detection of any deviation from normal allows intervention before the problem escalates. Peri-implant mucositis caught early is reversed with cleaning. Caught late, it becomes peri-implantitis requiring surgery. The difference is a check-up appointment versus a surgical procedure.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [implant placement at £1,999](/pricing) includes the treatment plan, surgery, and follow-up. The [aftercare pathway](/blog/dental-implant-aftercare) includes monitoring appointments to catch any complications early. For patients experiencing symptoms around an existing implant (pain, swelling, loosening, bleeding gums), the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing).

A 95-97% success rate means that the vast majority of implants sit quietly in the jaw for decades, functioning perfectly. The 3-5% that encounter complications face treatable, manageable issues with established solutions. Knowing what to watch for, and having a dentist who monitors for it, keeps the odds firmly in your favour.
