The pain started this morning and it's getting worse. Or something broke at lunch and now there's a sharp edge shredding the inside of your cheek. Or the swelling you noticed yesterday has spread, and your face looks different in the mirror.

Whatever the specifics, you've reached the same conclusion: this needs dealing with today. Not tomorrow, not next week, not at the next available appointment in three weeks. Today.

The question that follows immediately is whether that's even possible. Can you actually see a dentist the same day? And if you can, what does it cost?

The answers are more encouraging than most people expect. Same day emergency dental appointments are widely available across the UK at private practices, and the cost of being seen ranges from remarkably affordable to moderately premium depending on where you go and when you call.

## What Same Day Access Looks Like

Private dental practices across the UK hold emergency slots in their daily schedule. These are appointment slots kept deliberately open for people who call that morning with urgent problems. The practice doesn't book them in advance; they're reserved for the day itself.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), emergency appointments are available same day, and the appointment fee is [£20](/pricing). Call in the morning with a dental emergency, and you'll be seen that day. The £20 covers the examination, X-ray, diagnosis, and initial management of the problem.

Most other private practices charge £50-£200 for an [emergency appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk). The variation is mainly geographic: London practices at the higher end, practices outside London at the lower end. The appointment covers assessment and diagnosis; treatment, if needed, is an additional cost on top.

The key is calling early. Emergency slots fill up through the day, and calling first thing in the morning gives the best chance of being seen at a convenient time. By mid-afternoon, same day slots at popular practices may be taken, though many practices will fit genuine emergencies in even when the schedule is full.

## What Counts as a Dental Emergency

Practices triage emergency calls to ensure the limited same day slots go to the people who need them most. Understanding what qualifies as an emergency helps manage expectations and ensures you're directed to the right type of appointment.

Genuine emergencies that warrant same day attention include: severe toothache that isn't responding to over-the-counter painkillers, [facial swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache) (indicating infection), uncontrollable bleeding from the mouth, a [knocked-out permanent tooth](/blog/knocked-out-tooth-what-to-do-uk) (where the 30-minute reimplantation window makes speed critical), a [broken tooth](/blog/broken-tooth-emergency-repair-cost) with a sharp edge causing soft tissue damage, and trauma to the mouth from an accident or injury.

Urgent but not emergency situations that can usually wait 24-48 hours include: a [lost filling](/blog/lost-filling-emergency-fix) without severe pain (a pharmacy temporary filling kit bridges the gap), mild toothache that responds to painkillers, a [loose crown](/blog/loose-crown-emergency-fix) that can be temporarily recemented with denture adhesive, and [wisdom tooth](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) discomfort that's manageable.

The distinction matters practically because same day emergency appointments come with a premium over routine bookings at most practices. If the problem can safely wait for a standard appointment, the saving can be £50-£150. A [£5 temporary filling kit](/blog/lost-filling-emergency-fix) from Boots can be the difference between an emergency appointment today and a calm, cheaper appointment on Monday.

## What Happens During the Emergency Appointment

Same day emergency dental appointments follow a focused, efficient sequence.

The dentist examines the problem area. For pain cases, they're looking for the source: decay, cracks, infection, gum disease. For trauma, they're assessing damage to teeth and surrounding structures. An X-ray provides the clinical picture beneath the surface.

Then the immediate management. The goal of an emergency appointment is to address the acute problem: stop the pain, manage the infection, stabilise the damage. This might be:

Opening a tooth to drain an [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency) and relieve pressure. Prescribing [antibiotics](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) for infection. Placing a temporary filling over exposed tooth structure. Smoothing a sharp edge on a broken tooth. Extracting a tooth that's beyond saving and causing severe pain. Reimplanting a knocked-out tooth and splinting it in place.

The emergency appointment resolves the crisis. The follow-up appointment, booked during the visit, handles the definitive treatment: the permanent filling, the crown, the [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), whatever the tooth needs long-term.

This two-stage approach, crisis management today, definitive treatment later, is standard practice and makes good clinical sense. Treating an inflamed, infected, or traumatised area definitively on the same day isn't always optimal. Letting things settle first leads to better outcomes.

## The Full Cost Picture

The emergency appointment fee is just the starting point. The total cost depends on what treatment the emergency requires.

Emergency appointment fee: [£20 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), or £50-£200 at most practices.

Common treatments that might happen at the emergency appointment:

Temporary filling: £50-£100 (included at some practices, charged separately at others).

[Abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency) drainage and antibiotics prescription: £50-£150 for the drainage, £9.90 for the prescription.

Emergency [extraction](/blog/emergency-tooth-extraction-costs-uk): £100-£300 for a simple extraction, up to [£549 for a wisdom tooth](/pricing) at UrgentCare Dental.

Smoothing a broken tooth edge: often included in the emergency appointment fee.

Reimplantation and splinting of a knocked-out tooth: £100-£300 for the splinting.

Most same day emergency visits result in a total bill of £20-£300, covering the appointment and whatever immediate treatment is needed. The definitive treatment that follows (root canal, crown, implant) is a separate cost at a follow-up appointment.

## Finding Same Day Availability

The practical challenge of same day dental care isn't whether it exists. It's finding it at 8am when you're in pain and not thinking clearly.

Having a dental practice already saves enormous stress. If you're registered somewhere, that's your first call. Existing patients typically get priority for emergency slots, and the practice already has your records, X-rays, and medical history.

If you don't have a regular dentist, searching for "emergency dentist near me" brings up options, but the results can be overwhelming. A few things to look for: practices that explicitly mention same day emergency appointments, practices that list their emergency appointment fee (transparent pricing is a good sign), and practices with reviews mentioning emergency care.

The 111 service can direct you to emergency dental provision in your area, particularly useful [out of hours](/blog/out-of-hours-dentist-costs-uk) when regular practices are closed. Wait times for the callback vary, and the appointment offered might be the following day rather than same day, but it's a safety net when other options aren't available.

Dental A&E departments exist at some teaching hospitals in major cities. They see walk-in emergencies, usually with a wait, and they handle the acute problem before referring you to a practice for follow-up. These are free but the wait can be substantial.

## The Value of Same Day

There's a financial argument for same day dental care that goes beyond the appointment fee.

Dental problems that go untreated for days or weeks during the "I'll deal with it later" phase consistently become more expensive to treat. An exposed tooth that gets infected because the emergency wasn't attended to promptly. A crack that extends into the root because the temporary stabilisation didn't happen. An abscess that spreads because antibiotics weren't started when the swelling first appeared.

The emergency appointment is a cost. It's also an investment in preventing the problem from escalating into something significantly more expensive. The £20 emergency appointment at UrgentCare Dental that catches a problem early can prevent a bill ten times larger down the line.

And then there's the non-financial value. The relief of having the pain diagnosed and managed. The reassurance that the problem has a name, a solution, and a timeline. The ability to sleep that night without the anxiety of an unknown dental problem.

That's what same day access really provides. Not just treatment, but certainty. The uncertainty of "what's wrong and will it get worse?" is replaced by "here's what it is and here's how we fix it." And that replacement, from worry to plan, is worth every penny of the appointment fee.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), same day emergency appointments at [£20](/pricing) are designed to make that certainty accessible. Because a dental emergency is stressful enough without the cost of being seen adding to the pressure.
