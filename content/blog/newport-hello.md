Newport is easy to miss if you're not looking for it.

A small village in the East Riding, sitting quietly between Howden and the Humber. The M62 runs past but doesn't really stop. The Market Weighton Canal cuts through the middle. About 1,500 people live there, give or take, in a place that's been making bricks and minding its own business for a couple of centuries now.

It's not the kind of place that gets written about much. Which is part of why we wanted to write this.

We're UrgentCare Dental, based in Leeds at Whitehall Estate in Armley. From Newport, that's about forty minutes on the M62. Not around the corner, but not the other side of the world either. If you've ever needed to head into Leeds for anything else, you already know the route.

## Why We're Reaching Out

Living in a village means accepting certain trade-offs. The peace and space come with the reality that not everything is on your doorstep.

Dental care is often one of those things. Options locally can be limited, and when something urgent happens, knowing where to turn isn't always obvious.

We wanted you to know we exist. We're an emergency and urgent care dental practice, open seven days a week, with [£20 emergency appointments](/pricing) and same-day availability when you need it. We also offer the full range of general and [cosmetic dentistry](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), from check-ups through to [implants](/implants).

## An Open Door

If you've been putting off dental work because it felt like too much hassle to organise, we understand.

We've made things as simple as we can. [Pricing](/pricing) is online and transparent. Appointments can be booked quickly. And when you arrive, we'll take care of you properly, without rushing or judgement.

Newport's a long way from the noise of the city. But if you ever need a dentist and don't mind the drive, there's a team in Leeds that's happy to help.

We'll leave the light on.
