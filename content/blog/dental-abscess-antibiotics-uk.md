Your face is swollen. There's a throbbing, pulsing pain in your jaw that paracetamol barely touches. Something in your mouth tastes foul, a metallic, bitter taste that arrives when the swelling gets particularly intense. And you've just arrived at the conclusion that's been building for the past 24 hours: this is an abscess, and you need antibiotics.

You're right on both counts, probably. A [dental abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-emergency) is an infection, a pocket of pus that's formed either at the tip of a tooth root (periapical abscess) or in the gum alongside a tooth (periodontal abscess). And antibiotics are almost certainly part of the treatment.

Here's the thing that's worth understanding though: antibiotics are the first chapter of this story, not the whole book. They'll calm the infection, reduce the swelling, and take the pain from unbearable to manageable. They're brilliant at what they do. But on their own, without dental treatment to address what caused the infection, the abscess will come back. Understanding that relationship between the antibiotics and the dentistry changes how you think about the whole situation.

## What Gets Prescribed

The first-line antibiotic for dental abscesses in the UK is amoxicillin. It's a penicillin-type antibiotic that's been the go-to for dental infections for decades, and with good reason: it's effective against the specific bacteria that cause most dental abscesses, it's well-tolerated, and the side effects are generally mild.

The standard prescription is 500mg, three times a day, for five days. Fifteen capsules. You take them at roughly eight-hour intervals, with or after food.

For people with a penicillin allergy, metronidazole is the alternative. The dose is 400mg, three times daily, for five days. Metronidazole comes with one notable restriction: absolutely no alcohol while taking it. The interaction between metronidazole and alcohol causes severe nausea and vomiting. Even small amounts. Even cooking wine. It's one of those drug interactions where there's no grey area.

In more severe infections, or infections that aren't responding to a single antibiotic, the dentist might prescribe both amoxicillin and metronidazole together. This combination covers a wider spectrum of bacteria and hits the infection from two angles. It's more aggressive, but dental abscesses can involve several bacterial species, and the dual approach ensures coverage.

A prescription in the UK costs £9.90 per item. If you're prescribed both amoxicillin and metronidazole, that's £19.80. Prescriptions are free in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

## What the Antibiotics Actually Do

This is where it helps to understand what's happening beneath the surface.

A dental abscess forms when bacteria invade the tooth's interior (through a cavity, crack, or failed filling) and reach the pulp, the living tissue inside the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels. The bacteria multiply, the pulp tissue dies, and the infection spreads through the root tip into the surrounding bone.

The body's immune response walls off the infection, creating a pocket of dead white blood cells, bacteria, and fluid: pus. That pocket is the abscess. The swelling you can feel is the pressure of that pus building up with nowhere to go.

Antibiotics don't drain the abscess. They work in the bloodstream and tissue surrounding it, killing bacteria at the margins of the infection and preventing it from spreading further. The swelling subsides because the antibiotic is winning the battle at the edges. The pain eases because the pressure drops. Within 24-48 hours of starting antibiotics, most people feel dramatically better.

By day three, the acute crisis is usually over. The swelling is down, the pain is manageable, and life feels close to normal. By day five, when the course finishes, things feel genuinely good.

And this is the dangerous moment. Because feeling good is not the same as being fixed.

## Why Antibiotics Alone Aren't Enough

The antibiotics have dealt with the active infection. They've cleared the bacteria from the surrounding tissue. The swelling is gone, the pain is gone, and your face looks normal again. So you might think: sorted.

Except the source of the infection is still there. The dead pulp tissue inside the tooth. The cavity or crack that let bacteria in. The environment that bred the abscess in the first place. The antibiotics can't reach inside the tooth to fix those things. They work in living tissue with blood flow. Inside a dead tooth, there's no blood flow to deliver them.

Without dental treatment, what happens is predictable: weeks or months later, bacteria re-establish themselves, multiply in the same environment, and the abscess returns. Sometimes worse than before, because the bacteria that survived the first course of antibiotics may be slightly more resistant.

This cycle, antibiotics, relief, recurrence, more antibiotics, is one of the most common patterns in emergency dentistry. It's also one of the most avoidable, because a single dental appointment during the window of relief from the antibiotics can break the cycle permanently.

## The Dental Treatment That Fixes It

Once the antibiotics have calmed the infection, there are two main routes to prevent recurrence.

A [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) removes the infected pulp tissue from inside the tooth, cleans and disinfects the internal canals, and fills them with an inert material. The source of infection is eliminated entirely. The tooth is preserved, and a crown goes on top to protect it. Root canal treatment costs £300-£700, and the crown adds £500-£1,000.

An [extraction](/blog/emergency-tooth-extraction-costs-uk) removes the entire tooth, abscess source and all. It's the definitive solution: if the tooth isn't there, it can't get infected. Extraction costs £100-£300 for a straightforward removal, or up to £549 for a [wisdom tooth](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) at [UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

The choice between root canal and extraction depends on the tooth's condition. If there's enough healthy tooth structure remaining to support a crown, root canal treatment saves the tooth and keeps it functional. If the tooth is too damaged, if the infection has eroded too much bone around the root, or if the tooth was already failing, extraction is the cleaner path.

The dentist makes this assessment once the infection has settled. The antibiotics buy the window of time needed for proper diagnosis and treatment planning, which is exactly what they're meant to do.

## When an Abscess Is an Emergency

Most dental abscesses are painful and unpleasant but not medically dangerous. Antibiotics and follow-up dental treatment resolve them completely.

Some abscesses escalate beyond that, and recognising the signs matters.

Facial swelling that's spreading rapidly, particularly swelling that moves toward the eye, down the neck, or under the jaw, can indicate the infection is spreading into deeper tissue spaces. This is cellulitis, and it needs urgent medical attention. If swelling is visibly growing over the course of hours rather than days, an emergency dental appointment or A&E is the right call.

Difficulty breathing or swallowing suggests the swelling is encroaching on the airway. This is rare, but it's a genuine emergency that requires immediate hospital care.

Fever, chills, and feeling generally unwell (malaise) alongside the dental swelling indicate the infection may be entering the bloodstream. Antibiotics from a dentist or GP are urgent at this point.

An abscess that's been present for weeks without treatment is more likely to have spread beyond the immediately visible swelling. The longer an infection runs without intervention, the more territory it claims.

For most people, a dental abscess is an unpleasant experience that resolves with antibiotics and dental treatment within a week or two. The emergency flags above apply to a small percentage of cases, but they're worth knowing because early recognition makes the treatment much simpler.

## Getting Antibiotics: The Routes

There are several ways to get a prescription for dental abscess antibiotics, and the access is quicker than most people expect.

An [emergency dental appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk) is the ideal route. The dentist assesses the tooth, prescribes appropriate antibiotics, provides pain relief, and begins planning the definitive treatment. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), an emergency appointment is just [£20](/pricing).

A GP can prescribe dental antibiotics in many cases, particularly when a dental appointment isn't immediately available. The GP won't be able to provide the dental treatment, but they can start the antibiotic course to bring the infection under control while you arrange a dental appointment.

The 111 service can arrange an out-of-hours prescription when the abscess flares up at night or over a weekend. The callback system triages the situation, and if antibiotics are appropriate, a prescription can be issued.

Some online pharmacies offer consultations with prescribers who can issue dental antibiotic prescriptions. This can be convenient, but it bypasses the in-person assessment that ensures the right antibiotic is prescribed for the right infection. An online prescriber can't look inside your mouth.

The fastest and most effective route is always the dentist. They prescribe the antibiotics and plan the treatment that prevents recurrence, handling both halves of the solution in one visit.

## The Cost of the Whole Thing

Here's the full financial picture for resolving a dental abscess, from antibiotics to permanent fix.

The emergency dental appointment: £20 at UrgentCare Dental, or £50-£200 at most UK private practices.

The antibiotic prescription: £9.90 in England (free in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland).

Follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence:

A root canal (to save the tooth) costs £300-£700, plus a crown at £500-£1,000. Total for the abscess resolution including root canal: approximately £800-£1,900.

An extraction (to remove the tooth) costs £100-£300. Total for the abscess resolution including extraction: approximately £130-£520.

If the extraction creates a gap that needs replacing, a [dental implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) costs [£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing), a bridge costs £700-£1,500, or a [partial denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) costs £500-£1,500.

The antibiotics themselves are the cheapest part. The value they provide, bringing an acute infection under control so that proper treatment can happen calmly and effectively, is disproportionate to their modest cost.

## The Antibiotics-Then-Treatment Pattern

The sequence is always the same, and knowing it in advance makes the whole experience less chaotic.

Day one: the abscess is painful and swollen. Emergency dental appointment. Antibiotics prescribed. Pain management begins.

Days two to three: the antibiotics start working. Swelling reduces. Pain eases. The acute crisis passes.

Days three to five: significant improvement. The area settles. Eating becomes manageable. Life returns to something approaching normal.

Week two: the antibiotic course has finished. The infection is controlled. The definitive dental treatment (root canal or extraction) happens during this window, while the area is calm and settled.

Week three onwards: healing from the dental treatment. The cycle is broken. The abscess source is gone.

The whole arc, from crisis to resolution, takes about two to three weeks. And the thing that makes it work, the thing that prevents the cycle of recurrence, is not skipping the dental treatment once the antibiotics make you feel better.

That second appointment, the one where the actual tooth gets sorted, is where the story ends properly. The antibiotics wrote the first chapter. The dentist writes the last.
