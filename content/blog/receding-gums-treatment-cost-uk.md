You've noticed something in the mirror. The teeth look longer than they used to. There's more tooth visible above the gum line than there was a year ago, two years ago, whenever you last looked closely. Or maybe you've noticed sensitivity: a sharp zing when cold water hits a specific spot, right at the gum line where the tooth meets the pink.

The gums are receding. And the word "receding" carries a weight it deserves, because unlike most dental problems, gum recession is a one-directional process. Gum tissue, once lost, doesn't grow back on its own. The good news is that treatment exists for every stage of recession, from early preventive care that stops it progressing to surgical grafting that restores what's been lost. And the earlier it's caught, the simpler and cheaper the treatment.

## What's Actually Happening

Gum tissue normally sits snugly around each tooth, forming a collar that covers the root and the bone beneath. The junction between gum and tooth is sealed by a shallow groove called the sulcus, typically 1-3mm deep. This seal keeps bacteria, food, and fluid away from the delicate root surface and the bone that holds the tooth in place.

Recession occurs when this gum tissue pulls away from the tooth, migrating down the root (on upper teeth) or up the root (on lower teeth). The process exposes the root surface, which is covered by cementum rather than enamel. Cementum is softer, thinner, and more porous than enamel. It wears away easily, and the exposed dentin beneath it is directly connected to the tooth's nerve through thousands of tiny tubules.

This is why receding gums cause sensitivity. The exposed root surface transmits temperature changes, touch, and chemical stimuli directly to the nerve. That sharp zing from cold water or cold air is dentin hypersensitivity, and it's the most common symptom that brings people's attention to their receding gums.

## The Causes

**Aggressive brushing** is the most common cause, and the one that surprises people most. Hard-bristled toothbrushes, or soft brushes used with excessive force, abrade the gum tissue at the neck of the tooth. Over months and years, this mechanical trauma pushes the gum margin downward, exposing the root. The irony is pointed: the people most diligent about brushing are sometimes the ones causing the most recession.

**[Gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices)** (periodontitis) destroys the bone and connective tissue that support the gums. As the underlying support structures are lost, the gum tissue recedes because it has nothing to hold it in place. This is recession from disease rather than from trauma, and it tends to be more widespread (affecting multiple teeth) and more severe than brushing-related recession.

**Genetics** play a genuine role. Some people have naturally thin gum tissue (biotype), which is more susceptible to recession than thick tissue. The thin biotype is visible: the gum tissue looks translucent and delicate rather than thick and stippled. This inherited characteristic means some people develop recession despite excellent brushing technique and no gum disease.

**Tooth position** affects recession risk. Teeth that sit outside the normal arch (buccally positioned) have thinner bone and thinner gum tissue on their outer surface. These teeth are anatomically predisposed to recession because the covering tissue is already minimal.

**Orthodontic treatment** can cause recession if teeth are moved through bone that's too thin to support them. This is more a risk of aggressive tooth movement than of [orthodontics](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) itself, and modern treatment planning minimises it.

**Piercings** in the lip or tongue can traumatise the gum tissue through repeated contact. A metal stud or ring rubbing against the gum at the same spot, thousands of times a day, over months and years, produces localised recession that can be significant.

## The Stages

Recession is classified by how far the gum has migrated from its normal position, and the classification guides the treatment.

**Mild recession** (1-2mm): the gum has moved slightly, exposing a small amount of root surface. The tooth looks slightly longer than its neighbours. Sensitivity may or may not be present. The bone beneath the gum is intact. This stage is the easiest to treat and the most responsive to conservative management.

**Moderate recession** (3-4mm): more root is exposed. Sensitivity is common. A concavity (notch) may be visible at the gum line where the softer root surface has worn away from brushing. The bone beneath may show early loss. Treatment at this stage is more involved but still effective.

**Severe recession** (5mm+): significant root exposure. The tooth appears dramatically longer than its neighbours. Sensitivity is pronounced. Bone loss is common. The root may be visible almost to its tip. This stage requires surgical intervention for restoration.

## Treatment Options and Costs

### Addressing the Cause

Before treating the recession itself, the cause needs addressing. If aggressive brushing is responsible, switching to a soft-bristled brush and modifying technique (gentle circular motions rather than aggressive horizontal scrubbing) prevents further recession. If gum disease is the cause, [periodontal treatment](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) stabilises the condition before any restorative work.

This step costs little: a dental hygiene appointment (£60-£120), brushing instruction, and possibly a [deep cleaning](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) (scaling and root planing) at £200-£400 per quadrant.

### Desensitising Treatment

For mild recession where the primary concern is sensitivity rather than aesthetics, desensitising treatments can manage the symptoms without surgery.

Professional fluoride varnish, applied at the dental practice, seals the exposed dentinal tubules and reduces sensitivity. Cost: £20-£50 per application, repeated every 3-6 months.

Desensitising toothpaste (containing potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride) used daily provides ongoing symptom management. This is an at-home treatment that costs the price of specialist toothpaste.

Bonding agents applied to the exposed root surface create a thin, protective coating that blocks the tubules. Cost: £50-£150 per tooth. This lasts 6-12 months before needing reapplication.

### Composite Bonding at the Gum Line

For moderate recession with root surface concavities or aesthetic concerns, [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) can cover the exposed root. The dentist applies tooth-coloured composite resin to the exposed root surface, recreating the natural tooth contour at the gum line.

This is a non-surgical approach: no cutting, no stitches. The composite bonds to the root surface and protects it from sensitivity and wear. The result looks natural, with the composite blended to match the tooth colour.

Cost: £99-£250 per tooth, similar to a standard filling. The bonding lasts 5-7 years before needing replacement, and touch-ups are straightforward.

### Gum Grafting

For moderate to severe recession, gum grafting is the definitive treatment. It restores the lost tissue, covers the exposed root, and recreates the natural gum architecture.

**Connective tissue graft** is the most common technique. A small piece of tissue is taken from beneath the surface of the palate (the roof of the mouth), positioned over the exposed root, and stitched in place. The graft integrates with the existing gum tissue over 2-4 weeks, creating new, healthy gum coverage.

Cost: £400-£1,200 per area (typically covering 1-3 adjacent teeth). The variation reflects the extent of recession, the number of teeth involved, and whether a specialist periodontist performs the surgery.

**Free gingival graft** takes tissue from the surface of the palate rather than beneath it. This technique is used to increase the thickness of thin gum tissue rather than specifically cover root exposure. It's more commonly used for prevention in areas where the thin biotype makes future recession likely.

Cost: similar to connective tissue grafting.

**Pinhole surgical technique** is a newer, minimally invasive approach. Instead of taking tissue from the palate, the existing gum tissue is loosened through a tiny hole and repositioned over the exposed root. Collagen strips are inserted to stabilise the tissue in its new position.

The advantage is no palatal donor site (meaning less post-operative discomfort) and the ability to treat multiple teeth in one session. The technique is newer than traditional grafting, and fewer practitioners offer it, but the early results are promising.

Cost: £500-£1,500 per area.

**Alloderm and tissue substitutes** are processed collagen matrices that can replace palatal tissue as the graft material. These eliminate the need for a palatal donor site entirely, reducing post-operative discomfort. They integrate similarly to the patient's own tissue, though some studies suggest slightly lower long-term outcomes compared to autogenous (patient's own tissue) grafts.

### The Treatment Decision

| Stage | Primary Concern | Treatment | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mild (1-2mm) | Sensitivity | Desensitising treatment | £20-£150 |
| Mild (1-2mm) | Aesthetics | Composite bonding | £99-£250/tooth |
| Moderate (3-4mm) | Coverage | Gum grafting | £400-£1,200/area |
| Severe (5mm+) | Coverage + structure | Gum grafting + bone | £800-£2,000/area |
| Multiple teeth | Comprehensive | Pinhole technique | £500-£1,500/area |

## Recovery from Gum Grafting

The palatal donor site (where the tissue was taken from) is the source of most post-operative discomfort. The roof of the mouth has a wound that heals over 7-14 days. During this time, eating is restricted: hot, crunchy, and spicy foods irritate the healing palate. A protective plate (similar to a thin denture that covers the palate) can be worn to shield the area during eating.

The graft site in the gums heals over 2-4 weeks. The grafted tissue initially looks pale or white (reduced blood supply), then gradually pinks up as blood vessels grow into it. By 4-6 weeks, the graft is indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue.

Brushing at the graft site is paused for 2 weeks, then resumed gently with a soft brush. A chlorhexidine mouthwash is used during the no-brushing period to keep the area clean.

Most people return to normal eating and activities within 1-2 weeks, with full healing complete by 4-6 weeks.

## Prevention

For people with early recession or risk factors for recession, prevention is significantly cheaper and simpler than treatment.

A soft-bristled toothbrush, replaced every 3 months, is the foundation. The bristles should bend when pressed against the teeth, not stand rigid. Hard and medium bristles are the primary culprits in brushing-related recession.

Technique matters more than pressure. Gentle, circular motions at the gum line, angled 45 degrees toward the gum, clean effectively without traumatising the tissue. Two minutes of gentle brushing cleans better than 30 seconds of aggressive scrubbing.

An electric toothbrush with a pressure sensor is a worthwhile investment for people who tend to brush too hard. The sensor alerts when excessive force is applied, retraining the brushing habit.

Regular dental hygiene appointments (every 6-12 months) include professional assessment of gum tissue levels. The hygienist measures recession at each tooth and tracks changes over time, catching progression early.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the check-up includes gum tissue assessment and, where recession is identified, a conversation about the cause, the stage, and the treatment options. From desensitising treatments to bonding to specialist grafting referrals, the pathway is matched to the severity.

Gums don't grow back on their own. But with the right treatment, the coverage can be restored, the sensitivity resolved, and the progression stopped. The earlier that conversation happens, the simpler and more affordable the solution.
