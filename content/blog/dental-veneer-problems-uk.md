The veneers went on and the transformation was everything you hoped for. Bright, even, natural-looking teeth that made the mirror a friendlier place. Weeks passed, maybe months, maybe years. And now something has changed. A chip at the edge. A veneer that feels slightly loose. Sensitivity to cold that wasn't there before. A dark line appearing at the gum margin.

Veneers are durable, beautifully made restorations that genuinely transform smiles. They're also thin pieces of material bonded to the front of teeth, and like anything in the mouth, they exist in an environment of constant force, temperature change, and chemical exposure. Things can happen.

The reassuring part: most veneer problems are fixable, most are preventable, and the catastrophic failure rates are genuinely low. Understanding what can go wrong turns each potential issue from a mystery into a known quantity with a known solution.

## Chipping and Fracture

The most common veneer problem, and the one that produces the most visible effect.

[Porcelain veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk) are strong, but they're thin: typically 0.3-0.5mm thick. They resist vertical biting forces well (the forces they're designed for) but are more vulnerable to lateral forces: sideways stress, edge loading, and point impacts.

Biting into hard foods with the edge of a veneer is the classic cause. Corn on the cob, crusty bread torn with the front teeth, ice, hard sweets, bottle caps (genuinely, people do this). The veneer wasn't designed for these forces. A natural tooth might survive them. A veneer, bonded to the front of that tooth, can chip.

Small chips at the edge of a porcelain veneer can sometimes be smoothed and polished, restoring the contour without replacing the veneer. This costs £50-£150 and takes 20-30 minutes. The repair is cosmetic and functional, though the polished area may have a slightly different surface texture than the glazed porcelain.

Larger chips or fractures that expose the underlying tooth typically require the veneer to be replaced. The old veneer is removed (ground off, since it's bonded to the tooth), a new impression is taken, and a new veneer is fabricated and bonded. Cost: the full veneer fee again, which is [£695 per tooth at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing) for porcelain, or £300-£1,200 across the UK depending on the type and the practice.

[Composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) veneers chip more readily than porcelain (the material is softer) but are also easier and cheaper to repair. A composite chip is repaired chairside: the dentist adds new composite to the chipped area, sculpts it, and polishes it. Cost: £50-£150. No impression, no lab, no second visit. This repairability is one of the genuine advantages of [composite bonding over porcelain](/blog/veneers-vs-bonding-uk).

## Debonding

A veneer comes loose. It might pop off cleanly, leaving the prepared tooth surface underneath. Or it might loosen gradually, with a slight movement felt when you press on it.

Debonding happens when the adhesive bond between the veneer and the tooth surface fails. The causes include:

Poor bonding during placement, where contamination (saliva, blood) prevented the adhesive from forming a strong connection. This tends to show up relatively early, within the first few months.

Tooth decay developing at the margin where the veneer meets the tooth. The decay undermines the bond from the edge, weakening the seal until the veneer lifts. This is a maintenance issue: the margins need the same diligent cleaning as natural tooth surfaces.

Excessive biting forces, particularly from [teeth grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) (bruxism). The sustained force of clenching and grinding stresses the adhesive bond repeatedly, eventually fatiguing it to failure. Patients who grind benefit from wearing a night guard to protect their veneers during sleep.

If a veneer comes off cleanly and the tooth surface underneath is intact, the veneer can often be rebonded: cleaned, checked, and cemented back on. Cost: £50-£150 for a rebond. If the veneer broke during debonding, replacement is needed.

The important thing when a veneer comes off is to keep it. Wrap it in tissue, put it in a small container, and bring it to the appointment. A veneer that's been lost or damaged can't be rebonded.

## Sensitivity

New sensitivity after veneer placement is common and almost always temporary.

Preparing a tooth for a veneer involves removing a thin layer of enamel from the front surface: 0.3-0.5mm for porcelain veneers, even less for minimal-preparation veneers. This preparation exposes dentin, the layer beneath the enamel that contains fluid-filled tubules connected to the nerve. When these tubules are stimulated by temperature changes, they transmit a sharp, transient pain.

The veneer itself covers and seals these tubules, but the seal isn't always perfect from day one. Small gaps at the margins, the bonding agent settling, and the tooth adjusting to its new surface covering can all contribute to sensitivity in the first few weeks.

This sensitivity resolves on its own in 2-6 weeks as the tubules calcify (seal themselves from the inside) and the bonding agent fully cures. Desensitising toothpaste during this period helps: the potassium nitrate in these toothpastes calms the nerve response.

Sensitivity that persists beyond 6-8 weeks, or sensitivity that develops months after placement, warrants assessment. Persistent sensitivity might indicate a gap at the veneer margin that's allowing fluid ingress, or it could signal that the tooth preparation got too close to the nerve. In rare cases, a tooth that's been prepared for a veneer needs [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) because the preparation stressed the nerve beyond recovery.

## Colour Mismatch

Getting the colour right is one of the most nuanced aspects of cosmetic dentistry, and slight mismatches do occur.

A veneer that looks perfect under the dental surgery's lighting might look different under the warm lights at home, or in daylight, or under the fluorescent lighting at work. This isn't a defect in the veneer; it's the complex reality of how colour perception changes with light source. Quality ceramic veneers are colour-matched under multiple light sources to minimise this effect, but the physics of light mean that slight shifts are unavoidable.

More noticeable mismatches occur when veneers are placed on some teeth but not others. If the four front teeth get veneers but the canines and premolars don't, the contrast between the bright veneers and the natural teeth can look obvious. The solution is either whitening the natural teeth to better match the veneers, or extending the veneers to include the adjacent teeth for a seamless transition.

Composite veneers can stain over time, particularly from coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco. Porcelain veneers are stain-resistant (the glazed surface repels most staining agents), but the composite cement at the margins can stain, creating a visible dark line where the veneer meets the tooth.

Professional cleaning and polishing restores composite veneers and cleans stained margins on porcelain veneers. This is part of routine dental hygiene appointments and doesn't require veneer replacement.

## The Gum Line Problem

Over time, the gum tissue around a veneer can recede, exposing the tooth surface below the veneer's edge. This creates a visible line: the margin where the veneer ends and the natural tooth begins. On a porcelain veneer, this shows as a dark line at the gum; on a composite veneer, it shows as a colour change.

Gum recession is a natural process that accelerates with aggressive brushing, [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices), and age. It happens to natural teeth too, but it's more noticeable on veneered teeth because the margin between veneer and tooth becomes visible.

Options for addressing exposed margins include: extending the veneer to cover the newly exposed tooth surface (essentially remaking the veneer with a slightly different shape), [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) at the margin to close the gap cosmetically, or gum grafting to restore the gum tissue to its original level.

This is typically a 10-15 year issue rather than an early one. Veneers placed with margins slightly below the gum line (common practice for aesthetics) have a longer grace period before recession exposes the margin.

## [Turkey Teeth](/blog/turkey-teeth-uk-veneers-cost)

The specific problems associated with veneers done abroad, particularly in Turkey, deserve mention because they represent a distinct category of veneer issues.

Aggressive tooth preparation (grinding teeth down to pegs for full crowns marketed as "veneers"), poor-quality materials, inadequate bonding, and lack of follow-up care create a concentration of problems that manifest over 2-5 years: widespread debonding, decay under the restorations, gum disease around poorly fitting margins, and the painful realisation that corrective treatment in the UK costs more than the original work abroad.

The distinction between a genuine veneer (a thin shell bonded to the front of an intact tooth) and what's often sold as "veneers" abroad (full crowns placed after aggressive tooth reduction) is the core issue. A veneer preserves tooth structure. Aggressive crowning removes it permanently.

## The Longevity Numbers

Porcelain veneers last 10-15 years on average, with many lasting 20+ years. The failure rate is approximately 5% at 10 years, meaning 95% of porcelain veneers are still functioning well a decade after placement.

[Composite veneers](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) last 5-7 years on average. They're more susceptible to staining, chipping, and wear than porcelain, but they're also more affordable and more easily repaired.

The [cost-per-year calculation](/blog/veneers-vs-bonding-uk) often informs the choice: porcelain veneers at [£695](/pricing) lasting 12 years work out to about £58 per year. Composite bonding at [£299](/pricing) lasting 5 years works out to about £60 per year. The annual cost is remarkably similar; the difference is in how often you need to revisit.

## Prevention

Most veneer problems are preventable with practical care.

A night guard (occlusal splint) protects veneers from grinding forces during sleep. Cost: £100-£300. This is the single most cost-effective protective measure for anyone with veneers who grinds their teeth.

Avoiding hard foods with the front teeth preserves veneer edges. Bite into apples by cutting them first. Break chocolate by hand rather than biting. Use back teeth for crushing, front teeth for clean biting.

Good oral hygiene at the veneer margins prevents the decay and gum disease that undermine the bond. The veneer itself can't decay, but the tooth beneath it can. Brushing and flossing at the gum line where the veneer meets the tooth is critical.

Regular dental check-ups catch early problems (small chips, margin gaps, gum recession) before they become bigger problems. A veneer issue caught early is cheaper and simpler to address than one that's progressed.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), veneer consultations cover the options ([composite at £299](/pricing), [porcelain at £695](/pricing)), the expected longevity, and the maintenance plan. For patients with existing veneer problems, the assessment determines whether repair, rebonding, or replacement is the best path forward.

Veneers change smiles. Looking after them keeps the change lasting.
