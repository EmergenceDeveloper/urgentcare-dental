There's something about Pudsey that resists being swallowed up by Leeds.

It's technically part of the city now, has been since the 1974 boundary changes, but it never quite feels that way. The town centre still has its own gravity. The park, the market, Pudsey St Lawrence cricket club in the summer. People say they're *from* Pudsey, not from Leeds. That distinction matters.

We're at UrgentCare Dental, based in Armley at Whitehall Estate. Depending on which part of Pudsey you're in, that's somewhere between five and fifteen minutes away. Closer than the city centre, probably closer than wherever you've been going.

We wanted to introduce ourselves properly.

## Who We Are

We're an emergency and urgent care practice first and foremost. The kind of place you call when something's gone wrong: a cracked tooth, sudden pain, something that can't wait until next week. [Emergency appointments](/pricing) are £20, and we're open every day of the week.

But we're not just emergencies. We offer the full range of dental care, from routine check-ups to [cosmetic work](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) like bonding and whitening, through to [implants](/implants) and reconstructive work. Dr. Zain Chishty leads the clinical team, and we've built something here that we're genuinely proud of.

## The Invitation

If you've been meaning to sort your teeth out but haven't got around to it, consider this a nudge.

We're not going to ask why it's been a while. We're not going to make you feel bad about anything. We're just going to help you get to where you want to be, at prices that are [clear and upfront](/pricing).

Pudsey's a good place. Unpretentious, solid, gets on with things. We like to think we're a bit the same.

If you ever need a dentist, we're just down the road.
