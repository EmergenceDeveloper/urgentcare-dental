As a child, a loose tooth was exciting. It meant the tooth fairy was coming. As an adult, a loose tooth is something entirely different: a cold, unsettling realisation that a permanent tooth, something that's supposed to stay put for a lifetime, is moving.

The wobble might be subtle. A slight give when you press on the tooth with your tongue. A sense that it shifts when you bite down on something firm. Or it might be obvious: the tooth visibly moves, tips to one side, or feels like it might come out.

Adult teeth don't loosen without a reason. The reason determines whether the tooth can be saved, and the range of outcomes is wider than most people expect. Some loose teeth can be stabilised and kept for years. Others have lost too much support and need [extracting](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk). The assessment tells you which category yours falls into.

## Why Adult Teeth Become Loose

### Gum Disease (Periodontitis)

The most common cause, by a considerable margin. [Gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) destroys the bone and connective tissue that hold the tooth in the jaw. As the supporting structures dissolve, the tooth's anchorage weakens, and it begins to move.

The progression is gradual. The gum tissue pulls away from the tooth, forming deep pockets. Bacteria colonise these pockets. The inflammatory response destroys the bone around the roots. The tooth, still structurally intact, becomes loose because its foundation is disappearing.

By the time the tooth is noticeably loose, the bone loss is often substantial: 50% or more of the original bone height may be gone. The X-ray reveals the story clearly: bone that should reach almost to the crown sits instead halfway down the root, or lower.

Periodontitis is painless in its early and moderate stages, which is precisely why the looseness often arrives as a surprise. The bone has been disappearing for years, but because it doesn't hurt, there were no alarms until the tooth started moving.

### Trauma

A blow to the face, a fall, a sports injury, or any impact to the mouth can loosen one or more teeth. The impact damages the periodontal ligament (the connective tissue fibres that attach the tooth to the bone), and the tooth becomes mobile.

Trauma-related looseness has a better prognosis than gum disease-related looseness because the bone is usually intact. The supporting structure is all there; it's just been jarred. Given time and protection, the ligament can heal and the tooth can restabilise.

### Teeth Grinding (Bruxism)

[Teeth grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) subjects teeth to forces far exceeding normal chewing. The sustained, heavy clenching of bruxism, particularly during sleep, can gradually loosen teeth by fatiguing the periodontal ligament. The bone may be healthy, but the ligament is being overloaded.

Grinding-related looseness is often accompanied by other signs: worn tooth surfaces, jaw pain on waking, headaches, and notching at the gum line (abfraction lesions caused by the flexing of the tooth under excessive load).

### Abscess

An [infection at the tooth's root](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) destroys the bone immediately around the root tip. As the abscess expands, the bone destruction extends, and the tooth's anchorage weakens. An abscessed tooth may be loose and tender to the touch.

This cause is distinguishable from gum disease because the looseness is accompanied by pain and possibly [swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache). The X-ray shows a localised dark area at the root tip rather than the widespread bone loss pattern of periodontitis.

### Pregnancy

Hormonal changes during pregnancy increase blood flow to the gums and alter the inflammatory response, causing pregnancy gingivitis. In some cases, the hormonal changes also affect the periodontal ligament, causing temporary tooth looseness. This resolves after pregnancy and doesn't typically require treatment beyond good oral hygiene and professional cleaning.

## How Looseness Is Assessed

The dentist grades tooth mobility on a clinical scale:

**Grade 1:** the tooth moves less than 1mm horizontally. Detectable by pressing on it with an instrument but not with the tongue. This is the earliest stage and has the best prognosis.

**Grade 2:** the tooth moves more than 1mm horizontally. Visible movement when pressed. The tongue can detect it. The tooth may move when chewing firm food. This stage requires active treatment.

**Grade 3:** the tooth moves in all directions, including vertically (up and down in its socket). The tooth is severely compromised. Prognosis for retention is poor.

The assessment includes periodontal probing (measuring pocket depths around the tooth), X-rays (showing bone levels), and clinical examination of the gum tissue and surrounding teeth. The goal is to understand why the tooth is loose and how much support remains.

## Treatment Options

### Periodontal Treatment (Gum Disease-Related Looseness)

If gum disease is the cause, treating the disease is the first step. [Deep cleaning](/blog/deep-cleaning-teeth-cost-uk) (scaling and root planing) removes the bacterial deposits from the deep pockets around the loose tooth. The goal is to halt the bone destruction and allow the gum tissue to heal.

After deep cleaning, the gum tissue tightens around the tooth as inflammation resolves. This tightening provides some stabilisation. The bone that's been lost won't regrow, but the remaining bone can stabilise, and the tooth can tighten in its socket over 4-8 weeks.

Cost: £200-£400 per quadrant for deep cleaning. Ongoing periodontal maintenance every 3-4 months thereafter.

For teeth with moderate looseness (Grade 1-2) and adequate remaining bone, periodontal treatment can stabilise the tooth for years. The tooth may never be as firm as it was before the bone loss, but it can remain functional and comfortable.

### Splinting

A loose tooth can be physically stabilised by bonding it to the adjacent stable teeth. The dentist bonds a thin fibre or wire to the back surfaces of the loose tooth and its neighbours, connecting them into a unit. The loose tooth borrows stability from its neighbours.

Splinting is used when the tooth has a reasonable prognosis but needs time and support to stabilise after periodontal treatment or trauma.

Cost: £150-£400, depending on the number of teeth involved.

### Occlusal Adjustment

If [grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) or a bite problem is contributing to the looseness, adjusting the bite reduces the excessive forces on the loose tooth. The dentist selectively reshapes the biting surfaces so that forces are distributed more evenly, taking pressure off the compromised tooth.

A night guard (occlusal splint) protects the teeth during sleep, when grinding forces are strongest. Cost: £100-£300 for the night guard; occlusal adjustment is typically included in the treatment plan.

### Root Canal Treatment

If an [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) is causing the looseness, [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) eliminates the infection, and the bone around the root tip regenerates over months. As the bone heals, the tooth restabilises.

Cost: £600-£1,400 for root canal treatment, plus a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) if needed.

### Extraction

When the bone loss is too severe (Grade 3 mobility, bone loss extending to the root apex), the tooth can't be saved. [Extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk) removes the loose tooth, and replacement options are discussed.

For a single missing tooth: a [dental implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk) ([£1,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing)) replaces the root and crown. A [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk) uses adjacent teeth as anchors. A [partial denture](/blog/partial-dentures-vs-full-dentures-cost) provides a removable replacement.

For multiple loose teeth: the treatment plan considers which teeth are saveable and which aren't, designing a solution that maximises the remaining dentition while replacing the teeth that can't be kept.

## Can a Loose Tooth Tighten Back Up?

Yes, in specific circumstances.

After **trauma**, a tooth with intact bone support can restabilise within 2-6 weeks as the periodontal ligament heals. Splinting provides support during this healing period.

After **periodontal treatment**, a tooth with adequate remaining bone can tighten as the gum inflammation resolves and the tissue firms up. The improvement is gradual, over weeks to months, and the tooth may not return to full firmness, but it can stabilise enough for comfortable function.

After **abscess treatment**, a tooth can restabilise as the bone around the root tip heals and regenerates.

After **pregnancy**, hormonally-related looseness resolves as hormone levels normalise.

A tooth loosened by **severe bone loss from long-standing gum disease** is unlikely to restabilise significantly. Once the bone is gone, the support isn't coming back. Treatment can prevent further loss and stabilise what remains, but it can't rebuild the foundation.

## The Assessment

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), a loose tooth assessment includes clinical examination, periodontal probing, and X-ray imaging. The X-ray reveals the bone levels around the tooth and identifies the cause of the looseness. The treatment plan covers stabilisation options, expected outcomes, and costs.

The [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing) for patients with acute symptoms (a tooth that's become suddenly loose from trauma or infection). For patients with gradually progressive looseness from gum disease, a scheduled assessment provides the comprehensive evaluation needed to plan treatment.

A loose adult tooth is unsettling. The good news is that many loose teeth can be stabilised and kept. The key is assessment: understanding why it's loose, how much support remains, and what treatment can preserve it. That assessment turns the unsettling wobble into a clear path forward.
