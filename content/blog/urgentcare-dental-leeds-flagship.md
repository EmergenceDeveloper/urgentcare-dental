There's a new dental practice in Leeds, and it's not quite like anything else in the city.

We've just opened our flagship clinic at Whitehall Estate in Armley. The building is ours. The vision is ours. And the model we're running challenges pretty much everything you'd expect from private dentistry in the UK.

Emergency appointments cost £20. Not £90, not £150, not the £200+ that's become standard for [weekend emergencies](/blog/weekend-emergency-dentist-prices-uk) across West Yorkshire. Twenty pounds, with X-rays included, to see a dentist who can actually help.

Pain doesn't wait. So neither should the care.

The Whitehall Estate location was chosen deliberately. Fifteen minutes from Leeds city centre, easy parking, proper space to build something that works. The kind of place you can actually get to when you're in crisis, rather than circling for a spot while your tooth throbs.

## What We Actually Do

Emergency and urgent care is our foundation. It's in the name, and it's where we started. When you're in pain at 9pm and your regular dentist won't see you until next Thursday, that's when you need us.

But we're not just an emergency room for teeth. We do the whole thing.

[General dentistry](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk). [Cosmetic work](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing). [Implants](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk). [Clear aligners](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk). [Veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk). [Crowns](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) and [bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk). The treatments people actually need, priced so they can actually afford them.

A check-up here costs £20. A filling starts at £99. [Composite bonding](/blog/veneers-vs-bonding-uk) is £299 per tooth. These aren't introductory offers that vanish after three months. They're just what we charge.

The idea is simple enough: make good dental care accessible to people who've been priced out of it. There's a lot of people in Leeds, and across the North, who've been putting off dental work for years because everywhere they looked wanted £150 just for a consultation. That's not how it should work.

## Why Leeds

Leeds needed this.

The city has dental practices, obviously. But emergency coverage has gaps you could drive a bus through, and prices have crept up to the point where a Sunday toothache becomes a genuine financial decision. Do you pay £200 to get seen today, or do you tough it out until Monday and hope it doesn't get worse?

That's not a choice anyone should have to make. Pain is pain. It doesn't care what day of the week it is or what your bank balance looks like.

We wanted to build something in a city that would actually use it. Leeds has the population, the need, and frankly, the character. This is a city that appreciates people who get on with things rather than just talking about them.

So here we are. Getting on with it.

## The Team

Dr. Zain Chishty is our Clinical Director, and he's the reason any of this exists. The vision for UrgentCare Dental came from watching how broken the system had become and deciding to build something better instead of just complaining about it.

The team around him shares that energy. Dentists who actually want to help people, who chose this work because it matters, not because it's the most lucrative path in medicine. There's a difference, and you can feel it when you walk in.

We're not a corporate chain. There's no distant head office making decisions based on spreadsheets. The people who treat you are the people who built this place. That matters more than any mission statement could.

## Where to Find Us

Unit 2 Ashfield Way, Whitehall Estate, Leeds LS12 5JB.

We're open extended hours because dental emergencies don't happen at convenient times. If you need us, [get in touch](/contact). If you're not sure whether what you're dealing with counts as urgent, get in touch anyway. We'd rather tell you it can wait than have you suffer through something that didn't need to get that bad.

This is what we're building. A flagship practice in Leeds, with more to come across the North. Proper dental care, properly priced, actually available when people need it.

Welcome to UrgentCare Dental.
