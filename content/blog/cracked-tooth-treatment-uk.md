There's a moment that changes your relationship with a particular tooth. Maybe it was biting down on something hard: an olive pit, an unpopped popcorn kernel, a piece of bone in a stew. Maybe it happened during the night, hours of [grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) finally finding the weak point. Maybe there was no moment at all: just a growing awareness that something about this tooth isn't right. A twinge when chewing that's hard to pin down. A sensitivity that comes and goes. A feeling that the tooth is shifting under load in a way it didn't before.

Cracked teeth are among the most challenging dental problems to diagnose, because the crack itself is often invisible. Not chipped, where a piece is obviously missing. Not broken, where the damage is visible and dramatic. Cracked: a fracture line running through the tooth structure that may not show on an X-ray, may not be visible to the naked eye, and may produce symptoms that are inconsistent and confusing.

The diagnosis matters because different types of cracks have very different outcomes, from a simple filling to a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) to an [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk). Understanding the classification turns "something's wrong with this tooth" into a clear treatment path.

## The Types of Cracks

### Craze Lines

The shallowest type. Craze lines are tiny, hairline cracks in the outer enamel that don't extend into the dentin beneath. They're superficial fractures in the hardest tissue in the body, visible as faint vertical lines on the tooth surface, particularly noticeable when light shines through the teeth.

Nearly all adult teeth have craze lines. They're the wear and tear of decades of biting, temperature changes, and mechanical stress. They cause no symptoms, need no treatment, and are cosmetic observations rather than clinical problems.

Cost to treat: nothing. They're monitored rather than treated.

### Fractured Cusp

A cusp is one of the pointed peaks on the biting surface of a premolar or molar. A fractured cusp occurs when one of these peaks breaks away, typically around a large [filling](/blog/how-long-do-fillings-last). The break usually stays above the gum line and doesn't reach the nerve.

The symptom is often dramatic: a sudden crunch while chewing, followed by a piece of tooth coming loose. The tooth may be sensitive afterward but not acutely painful, because the fracture hasn't reached the nerve. The remaining tooth is structurally weakened but the root and nerve are intact.

Treatment: a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) to cap the remaining tooth and restore its shape and strength. If the fracture is small and the remaining tooth structure is sound, a large filling or onlay may suffice.

Cost: £99-£250 for a filling/onlay, or [£650 for a crown at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

### Cracked Tooth

This is the classification that carries the most clinical significance and produces the most confusing symptoms. A crack extends from the biting surface downward toward the root, running vertically through the tooth structure. The crack may or may not have reached the nerve.

The hallmark symptom is sharp pain on biting that disappears when the biting force is released. The crack flexes open under load, stimulating the nerve, then closes again when the load is removed. The pain is erratic: it happens with certain foods, certain teeth positions, certain biting angles, but not consistently. This inconsistency makes cracked tooth syndrome frustrating to diagnose and distressing to experience, because the tooth doesn't hurt all the time, just unpredictably.

Other symptoms: sensitivity to hot and cold (particularly cold), a lingering ache after eating, and discomfort that's hard to localise. Patients often can't identify which tooth is causing the problem because the pain refers to adjacent teeth and the crack doesn't produce continuous symptoms.

The diagnosis often involves a bite test: the patient bites on a small instrument placed on each cusp individually. When the instrument is positioned over the crack, biting down and then releasing produces the characteristic sharp pain on release.

Treatment depends on the crack's extent:

If the crack hasn't reached the nerve: a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) binds the tooth together, preventing the crack from flexing. This eliminates the pain by eliminating the movement. Cost: [£650 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

If the crack has reached the nerve: [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) to remove the damaged nerve, followed by a crown. Cost: £1,250-£2,050 combined.

If the crack extends below the gum line: the prognosis worsens significantly. Cracks that reach below the bone level are difficult or impossible to treat conservatively. [Extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk) may be the only option.

### Split Tooth

A split tooth is a cracked tooth that has progressed to the point where the crack divides the tooth into two distinct segments. The crack runs from the biting surface through the root, and the two halves can be separated.

A split tooth cannot be saved intact. The tooth is [extracted](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk), and replacement options ([implant](/blog/dental-implant-costs-uk), [bridge](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), or [denture](/blog/dentures-cost-uk)) are discussed.

In rare cases, if the split is favourable, the dentist may be able to save one portion of the tooth (one root with its attached crown structure) by extracting the other portion. This is uncommon but possible with multi-rooted molars.

Cost: extraction (£100-£600), plus replacement.

### Vertical Root Fracture

The opposite of the usual crack pattern. Instead of starting at the biting surface and working down, a vertical root fracture starts in the root and works up. These fractures are often the consequence of previous [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk): the root, weakened by the canal preparation and the absence of the natural nerve and blood supply, fractures under normal biting forces.

Vertical root fractures are notoriously difficult to diagnose. The symptoms can mimic infection: a deep ache, tenderness to pressure, a small [swelling](/blog/swollen-face-toothache) or sinus tract on the gum. X-rays may show bone loss along the root that looks like gum disease or a [failed root canal](/blog/failed-root-canal-retreatment-uk).

Treatment: [extraction](/blog/tooth-extraction-cost-uk). Vertical root fractures can't be repaired. The fracture provides a pathway for bacteria to enter the bone, and no amount of root canal treatment or crown work addresses a cracked root.

Cost: extraction (£100-£600), plus replacement.

## The Risk Factors

**Large existing fillings** weaken the tooth structure around them. A molar with a large filling has thin walls of tooth between the filling and the outer surface. These thin walls are more susceptible to fracture. The larger the filling, the higher the risk.

**[Teeth grinding](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions)** subjects the teeth to forces far exceeding normal chewing. The sustained, heavy clenching of bruxism, particularly during sleep, concentrates force on specific teeth and finds any weakness in the structure. Grinders crack teeth at significantly higher rates than non-grinders.

**Biting hard objects** is the acute cause. Ice, hard sweets, olive pits, bone fragments, pencils, bottle caps (seriously, people do this). Each incident of biting something harder than enamel risks a crack.

**Previous root canal treatment** weakens the tooth's internal structure. A root canal treated tooth that doesn't receive a [crown](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) is significantly more vulnerable to fracture. This is one of the strongest arguments for crowning root canal treated teeth promptly.

**Age** increases crack risk. Teeth develop more craze lines and structural fatigue over decades of use. Crack-related dental problems peak between ages 40 and 60.

**Temperature extremes** cause rapid expansion and contraction of the tooth structure. Biting into ice cream immediately after sipping hot coffee creates thermal stress that can initiate or propagate cracks.

## The Diagnosis

Cracked teeth don't always show on X-rays. The crack may be too fine, or oriented in a direction that the X-ray beam doesn't capture. This is one of the few situations in dentistry where the clinical examination is more informative than the imaging.

The dentist uses a combination of:

Bite testing with a cotton roll or a specialised bite tool. Transillumination: shining a bright light through the tooth to reveal crack lines (light stops at a crack, creating a visible shadow). Visual inspection with magnification (loupes or microscope). Probing around the tooth for localised pocket deepening (a sign of a crack extending below the gum).

If a crack is suspected but not confirmed, a CT scan provides three-dimensional imaging that reveals cracks invisible on conventional X-rays.

## The Emergency

A cracked tooth that's producing intermittent pain isn't a dental emergency in the same way that a [knocked-out tooth](/blog/knocked-out-tooth-what-to-do-uk) or a dental [abscess](/blog/dental-abscess-antibiotics-uk) is. But the pain is real, and the crack is progressing: each biting episode has the potential to extend the crack deeper into the tooth.

Avoiding chewing on the affected side reduces the risk of propagation. An over-the-counter painkiller manages the intermittent pain. And getting assessed promptly, within days rather than weeks, gives the best chance of treatment before the crack reaches the nerve or extends below the gum.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [emergency appointment is £20](/pricing), and crack assessment includes clinical examination and X-rays. Same-day crown preparation is available for teeth that need crowning to prevent crack progression. [IV sedation at £399](/pricing) is available for patients who prefer it.

A cracked tooth is a tooth in transition: from stable to unstable, from salvageable to unsaveable. The transition can be quick (if the crack extends suddenly) or slow (developing over months of grinding and chewing). Catching it during the salvageable phase, when a crown can bind it together and prevent the crack from reaching the nerve or root, is the difference between keeping the tooth and losing it.

The sooner the crack is identified, the simpler and cheaper the treatment. That's the one piece of the cracked tooth picture that's consistently true, regardless of the type.
