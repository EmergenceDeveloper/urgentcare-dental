You've been through the consultation. The CT scan has been reviewed. And the dentist has said something that felt like a door closing: "There's not enough bone for implants."

If you've heard that sentence, you know the specific feeling it produces. After months of researching implants, comparing prices, building up the courage and the finances, you've been told the one thing that seems to end the conversation entirely. No bone, no implants, no options.

Except that's not quite true anymore. And the solution is one of the most fascinating pieces of dental engineering in modern medicine.

Zygomatic implants anchor into the cheekbone instead of the jawbone. The zygoma, that solid ridge of bone you can feel beneath your eye and across your cheek, is dense, strong, and doesn't resorb the way jawbone does. It's the bone that never leaves, and for people with severe upper jaw bone loss, it's the foundation that makes full-arch implants possible when nothing else can.

## The Problem They Solve

The upper jawbone (maxilla) is uniquely vulnerable to bone loss. When upper teeth are lost, the bone that supported them begins to resorb. The maxillary sinuses, those air-filled cavities above the upper teeth, expand downward as the bone thins. Over years, the combination of resorption and sinus expansion can leave the upper jaw with insufficient bone for conventional implants.

[Bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk) is the standard solution: rebuilding the bone volume before placing implants. But major bone grafting in the upper jaw, particularly sinus lifts and ridge augmentation, adds 4-9 months of healing time and £1,500-£4,000 in cost. For some patients, the bone loss is so severe that even grafting can't create enough volume for reliable implant placement.

That's the clinical dead end where zygomatic implants offer a way through. Instead of trying to rebuild the missing jawbone, the surgeon bypasses it entirely and anchors into the cheekbone, a structure that's naturally dense, naturally thick, and hasn't been affected by the tooth loss that caused the problem.

## The Engineering

A conventional dental implant is 8-13mm long. A zygomatic implant is 30-55mm long. That difference in scale tells you something important: this is a fundamentally different approach.

The implant enters through the upper jaw and travels upward and backward, angling through any remaining maxillary bone and anchoring deep into the zygomatic bone. The angle is steep, sometimes 30-60 degrees from vertical, and the path is meticulously planned using CT imaging to avoid the sinuses and target the densest region of the cheekbone.

Two or four zygomatic implants on each side provide enough anchorage for a full arch bridge, typically combined with one or two conventional implants at the front of the mouth (where the bone tends to be better preserved). The result is a full set of upper teeth, permanently fixed, supported by a combination of jaw and cheekbone bone.

The structural logic is sound: the zygomatic bone handles substantial force (it's the bone that absorbs impact to the face), and implants placed into it have survival rates of 95-98% at five years and beyond.

## What It Costs

Zygomatic implant treatment in the UK ranges from £10,000-£25,000 per arch. The wide range reflects the variation in case complexity, surgical approach, bridge material, and geographic location.

London practices typically sit at the upper end: £15,000-£25,000. Outside London, particularly in the north of England, costs run £10,000-£18,000.

For a full upper arch using zygomatic implants, the total includes the implants themselves, the surgical placement, any additional conventional implants, the immediate temporary bridge (you leave the appointment with teeth), and the final permanent bridge.

Here's the comparison that matters for patients who've been told they need extensive bone grafting before conventional implants:

Conventional implants with major bone grafting: £12,000-£22,000 for the implants plus £3,000-£8,000 for the grafting, spread over 12-18 months of treatment.

Zygomatic implants without grafting: £10,000-£25,000, with teeth fitted the same day as surgery.

The total cost is often similar. But the timeline is dramatically different. Bone grafting adds 6-9 months of healing before implants can even be placed. Zygomatic implants eliminate that wait entirely.

## The Procedure

Zygomatic implant surgery is performed under sedation or, in complex cases, general anaesthetic. The procedure takes 2-4 hours, and it's performed by surgeons with specific training in zygomatic placement (this is specialist territory, not something every implant dentist offers).

The surgeon makes an incision in the upper gum, exposes the jawbone, and creates a channel that angles upward toward the cheekbone. Specialised instruments, longer than standard implant drills, prepare the pathway through the thin maxillary bone and into the dense zygoma.

The zygomatic implants are placed and assessed for primary stability. If conventional implants are part of the plan (typically in the anterior region), those go in during the same procedure.

Then the immediate loading happens. A temporary full-arch bridge is fitted directly to the implants before you leave. You walk into the appointment without teeth and walk out with a full set. They're temporary (acrylic), and they'll be replaced with permanent teeth in 3-6 months once everything has healed. But functionally and cosmetically, you have teeth from day one.

The recovery is comparable to conventional implant surgery: swelling for 3-5 days, discomfort managed with painkillers, soft food for the first two weeks, and a gradual return to normal eating.

## Who This Is For

Zygomatic implants aren't a first-line option. They're the solution for a specific group of patients:

People with severe upper jaw bone loss who've been told conventional implants aren't possible without major grafting. This includes patients who've been without upper teeth for many years, where the bone has had time to thin significantly.

Patients who've had failed bone grafts. Some grafting procedures don't take, leaving the patient back at square one. Zygomatic implants offer an alternative path that doesn't rely on bone volume in the jaw.

People who want to avoid the long timeline of bone grafting. A patient facing 12-18 months of grafting plus implant healing might choose zygomatic implants to compress the timeline to a single procedure with immediate teeth.

Long-term denture wearers whose jawbone has resorbed over decades. The combination of tooth loss and denture pressure accelerates bone loss, and the remaining bone may be too thin for any conventional approach.

For the lower jaw, zygomatic implants aren't applicable (the cheekbone doesn't connect to the lower jaw). Lower jaw bone loss is typically addressed with standard implants, [All-on-4](/blog/all-on-4-dental-implants-cost-uk) approaches, or short implants combined with [bone grafting](/blog/bone-grafting-dental-implants-cost-uk).

## The Limitations

Zygomatic implants are remarkable, but they're not without trade-offs.

The surgery is more complex than conventional implant placement. The long implant pathway, the angled approach, the proximity to the sinuses: all of this requires specific expertise and longer surgical time.

Not every implant practice offers them. You'll need a surgeon with zygomatic-specific training and experience, which may mean travelling to a specialist centre.

The risk of sinus complications is higher because the implant pathway passes near or through the maxillary sinus. Sinusitis occurs in a small percentage of cases and usually resolves with medication, but it's a consideration specific to this approach.

The cost is at the upper end of implant treatment. For patients with moderate bone loss where a sinus lift and conventional implants would work, that's likely the more straightforward and cost-effective path. Zygomatic implants come into their own when the moderate options have been exhausted.

## The Door That Reopens

For someone who's been told they can't have implants, zygomatic implants represent something beyond the clinical facts. They represent possibility.

The person who's been wearing a denture for fifteen years, who's watched their jawbone slowly thin, who went for an implant consultation and was told the bone wasn't there: that person had closed a door in their mind. Fixed teeth weren't an option for them anymore. The technology existed, but their anatomy didn't cooperate.

Zygomatic implants reopen that door. The bone that's needed was there all along, sitting in the cheekbone, dense and strong and waiting. The innovation was figuring out how to reach it.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the implant consultation includes a thorough assessment of bone volume and all available options. For patients with significant bone loss, the conversation includes zygomatic implants where appropriate, because "not enough bone" should be the beginning of a discussion about alternatives, not the end of the conversation entirely.

The cheekbone was always there. The technology to use it is here now. And for the people who need it, that combination means fixed teeth are possible after all.
