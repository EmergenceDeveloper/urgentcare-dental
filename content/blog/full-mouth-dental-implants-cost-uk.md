Here's the number that changes everything: you don't need 28 implants to replace 28 teeth.

That might sound obvious to a dentist, but if you're sitting there multiplying "cost per implant" by "number of teeth," you've just terrified yourself with a figure somewhere north of £80,000. The reality is much kinder. A full mouth of dental implants in the UK costs £20,000-£40,000, and the reason is beautifully simple.

Modern implant dentistry works more like a bridge than a fence. Instead of planting one post per tooth, a handful of titanium implants anchor an entire arch of teeth. Four implants per jaw is the standard. Eight implants total, and you walk out with a full set of fixed, permanent teeth.

That's the [All-on-4 technique](/blog/all-on-4-dental-implants-cost-uk), and it's why full mouth implants cost a fraction of what most people expect.

## How the Costs Actually Break Down

The price swings wildly depending on which method you go with, and there are three main routes to a full mouth of implant-supported teeth.

The most popular is All-on-4: four implants per arch supporting a fixed bridge of 10-14 teeth. This runs £8,000-£16,000 per jaw. Both jaws together, you're looking at £20,000-£30,000. It's the approach that made full mouth implants accessible to people who aren't millionaires, and it's been the gold standard since the early 2000s.

Then there's All-on-6, which does exactly what it sounds like: six implants instead of four. The extra two implants spread the chewing forces across a wider area, which can matter in the upper jaw where bone density tends to be lower. Per arch, this costs £11,000-£22,000. Both arches push the total to £25,000-£40,000.

And then there's the premium route: individual implants for every missing tooth. If you're replacing a full mouth this way, you're looking at 12-16 implants and a bill of £50,000-£70,000. Very few people go this route for a full mouth reconstruction, and very few clinicians recommend it. It's more surgery, more healing time, and more expense without a proportional benefit.

## What You're Really Paying For

The implant itself, that little titanium screw, costs the clinic about £100-£200. So where does the rest of your money go?

Surgery and planning take the biggest slice. A CT scan maps your jawbone in three dimensions. Software plans exactly where each implant sits, angled to hit the densest bone. The surgery itself takes two to four hours for a full mouth, and that's a specialist surgeon, an assistant, anaesthesia, and a sterile theatre.

Then there's the prosthetic: the actual teeth. This is where the biggest cost variable lives.

An acrylic bridge costs the clinic about £1,500 from a UK lab. These are the teeth you'll wear for the first few months while your implants integrate with the bone, and some people keep them permanently. A full mouth with acrylic bridges runs £20,000-£24,000 total.

A zirconia bridge costs the clinic £4,000-£5,000 from a premium lab. Zirconia is milled from a single block of ceramic. It's stronger than acrylic, more natural-looking, and essentially wear-proof. A full mouth with zirconia pushes the total to £30,000-£40,000.

The £10,000-£15,000 difference between acrylic and zirconia is purely about the teeth on top. The implants underneath are identical.

## The Geography of Pricing

Where you get treated matters, but perhaps not as dramatically as you'd think.

| Location | All-on-4 (both arches) | All-on-6 (both arches) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Central London | £28,000-£40,000 | £35,000-£50,000 |
| Greater London | £24,000-£35,000 | £30,000-£42,000 |
| Manchester / Leeds | £20,000-£28,000 | £25,000-£35,000 |
| Birmingham | £20,000-£27,000 | £24,000-£34,000 |
| Rest of England | £18,000-£25,000 | £22,000-£32,000 |
| Scotland / Wales | £18,000-£24,000 | £22,000-£30,000 |

London adds 20-40% to the bill. The North, Midlands, and devolved nations cluster together more tightly. The surgery is the same, the implant brands are the same, and the materials are the same. You're paying for postcodes and overheads.

## Why Four Implants Work as Well as Twenty

This is the question that catches people off guard, and the answer is one of the more elegant things in modern dentistry.

Each [dental implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) fuses with the jawbone over 3-6 months through a process called osseointegration. The bone literally grows into the titanium surface at a microscopic level. Once healed, each implant can withstand 200+ newtons of biting force.

The All-on-4 technique angles the two rear implants at 30-45 degrees. This does two things: it grips more bone surface (tilted implants contact up to 50% more bone than straight ones), and it avoids the sinus cavities in the upper jaw and the nerve canal in the lower jaw. That angling trick is why most people don't need bone grafts, which would add months and thousands of pounds to the treatment.

The bridge distributes force across all four points. Think of it like a table: four legs, each placed strategically, holds just as much weight as a table with eight legs placed randomly. Better engineering, fewer materials, same result.

At the 10-year mark, implant survival sits at 96.4% according to a meta-analysis led by Oxford and Liverpool university researchers. That's across all implant types and placements. Full-arch solutions perform similarly when placed by experienced surgeons.

## The Timeline Nobody Tells You About

Full mouth implants aren't a single appointment. The process spans 4-9 months from first consultation to final teeth, and understanding the stages explains a lot about the cost.

**Consultation and planning (2-4 weeks):** CT scans, photos, impressions. The treatment plan gets designed digitally. Some practices charge £200-£500 for this. Others fold it into the total.

**Surgery day:** Remaining teeth extracted (if needed), implants placed, temporary teeth fitted. You walk out with teeth that same day. The temporary bridge is acrylic and fully functional, though softer foods are recommended for the first few weeks.

**Healing (3-6 months):** Osseointegration happens beneath the gum. You're living with your temporary teeth during this period, eating and smiling normally. Check-ups every few weeks monitor the integration.

**Final prosthetic (2-4 weeks):** New impressions, bite registration, shade matching. The permanent bridge gets fabricated. It's fitted, adjusted, and polished. This is the moment where acrylic or zirconia makes its visual and financial difference.

## The Comparison That Actually Matters

The question isn't really "how much do full mouth implants cost?" It's "how much do they cost compared to the alternative?"

[Dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) for both arches run £2,000-£5,000 for a quality set. Dramatically cheaper upfront. But dentures need replacing every 5-10 years, need adhesive, need relining, and the jawbone beneath them resorbs over time because there are no implant roots stimulating it. Over 20 years, a good set of dentures costs £8,000-£20,000 in replacements and adjustments, and the jawbone keeps shrinking.

Full mouth implants preserve the jawbone. The titanium roots signal the bone to maintain itself, exactly like natural tooth roots do. Twenty years from now, your jaw looks the same as it does today. The [long-term comparison](/blog/dentures-vs-implants-costs) is closer than the sticker price suggests.

## Financing a Full Mouth

Nobody keeps £25,000 in a "just in case I need new teeth" account. That's why most implant clinics offer finance plans that spread the cost over 2-5 years.

Interest-free options exist at many practices for 12-24 month plans. Longer terms of 3-5 years carry interest, typically 9-15% APR, which adds £3,000-£8,000 to the total depending on the term and amount borrowed.

Monthly payments on a £25,000 full mouth treatment look something like:

| Finance term | Monthly payment | Total cost |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 12 months (0% interest) | £2,083 | £25,000 |
| 24 months (0% interest) | £1,042 | £25,000 |
| 36 months (9.9% APR) | £800 | £28,800 |
| 60 months (14.9% APR) | £595 | £35,700 |

Some patients split the treatment into phases, paying for each arch separately to make it more manageable.

## When Full Mouth Implants Aren't the Answer

Implants need bone. If years of missing teeth or [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) have left the jawbone severely depleted, bone grafting may be needed before implants can be placed. That adds £1,500-£4,000 per graft site and 4-6 months of healing time.

Certain medical conditions affect healing: uncontrolled diabetes, active cancer treatment, heavy smoking. None of these are absolute dealbreakers, but they change the conversation and the timeline.

For some people, particularly those with significant bone loss who want to avoid grafting, implant-retained [dentures](/blog/dentures-vs-implants-costs) offer a middle ground. Two to four implants per jaw anchor a removable denture that clips on and off. The cost sits at £8,000-£15,000 per arch, and it's a massive upgrade from conventional dentures in terms of stability.

## The Bottom Line on Full Mouth Costs

Full mouth dental implants in the UK cost £20,000-£40,000 for both jaws, depending on the method and materials. All-on-4 with acrylic teeth sits at the lower end. All-on-6 with zirconia sits at the upper end. Individual implants for a full mouth push well beyond £50,000 and are rarely recommended.

The surprise that keeps landing with patients at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) is that this is a fraction of what they expected. Eight implants, two arches, a full mouth of fixed teeth. The engineering does the heavy lifting so the price doesn't have to.
