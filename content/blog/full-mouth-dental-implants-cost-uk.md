Right, so you've been doing the maths. Cost of one implant, times the number of teeth you need replacing, and you've landed on a figure that made your heart sink. Somewhere around £60,000, £80,000, maybe more. That's the number bouncing around your head right now, isn't it?

Here's the thing though: that maths is completely wrong. And honestly, that's such good news.

Full mouth dental implants in the UK cost £20,000-£40,000 for both jaws. Not per jaw. Both. And the reason is one of those satisfyingly clever things that makes you wonder why you ever assumed otherwise.

You don't need one implant per tooth. Not even close. A full mouth of permanent, fixed teeth sits on just four to six implants per jaw. Eight to twelve implants total, and that's you sorted. A full set of teeth that look real, feel real, and stay put.

That's the [All-on-4 approach](/blog/all-on-4-dental-implants-cost-uk), and it genuinely changed everything about what's possible for people who need a whole new set of teeth.

## So What Are the Actual Numbers?

There are three main ways to do a full mouth, and the costs are quite different, so let's just lay them all out.

The most common route is All-on-4. Four implants per jaw, each one strategically placed to support a full arch of 10-14 teeth. This runs £8,000-£16,000 per jaw, so for both upper and lower you're looking at roughly £20,000-£30,000. This is the one that brought full mouth implants within reach for people who aren't sitting on a fortune, and it's been the go-to approach for over two decades now.

Then there's All-on-6: same idea, but with six implants instead of four. The extra two spread the chewing force across a wider area, which can be particularly helpful in the upper jaw where bone tends to be a bit less dense. This sits at £11,000-£22,000 per jaw, or £25,000-£40,000 for both.

And then there's the option of individual implants for every single tooth. If you're going this route for a full mouth, you're looking at something like 12-16 implants and a bill of £50,000-£70,000. Honestly, very few people go down this path for a full mouth, and very few dentists would recommend it either. It's more surgery, more healing, more expense, without a matching jump in results.

## Where Your Money Actually Goes

Something interesting: the implant itself, that little titanium screw that goes into your jawbone, costs the clinic about £100-£200. Which naturally makes you wonder where the rest of the money goes. It's a fair question.

The biggest chunk is the surgery and planning. A CT scan maps your jawbone in three dimensions. Specialised software works out exactly where each implant should sit, angled to hit the densest bone. The surgery itself takes two to four hours, and that's a specialist surgeon, an assistant, anaesthesia, a sterile theatre. All of that adds up.

But then there's the bit that causes the biggest swing in price, and it's something a lot of people don't realise until they're well into the process: the teeth themselves.

See, those teeth that go on top of the implants? They come in two main materials, and the difference is significant.

An acrylic bridge costs the dental lab about £1,500 to make. These work well, they look good, and plenty of people are perfectly happy with them long-term. A full mouth with acrylic bridges runs about £20,000-£24,000 total.

A zirconia bridge costs the lab £4,000-£5,000. It's milled from a single block of ceramic, stronger than acrylic, more natural-looking, and practically wear-proof. A full mouth with zirconia pushes things to £30,000-£40,000.

So that £10,000-£15,000 gap between the lower and upper end of the price range? It's all about which material sits on top. The implants underneath are identical either way.

## Does It Matter Where in the UK You Go?

It does, but maybe not as much as you'd think.

| Location | All-on-4 (both jaws) | All-on-6 (both jaws) |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Central London | £28,000-£40,000 | £35,000-£50,000 |
| Greater London | £24,000-£35,000 | £30,000-£42,000 |
| Manchester / Leeds | £20,000-£28,000 | £25,000-£35,000 |
| Birmingham | £20,000-£27,000 | £24,000-£34,000 |
| Rest of England | £18,000-£25,000 | £22,000-£32,000 |
| Scotland / Wales | £18,000-£24,000 | £22,000-£30,000 |

London adds 20-40% to the bill. Outside of London, prices cluster together more closely. The surgery is the same, the implant brands are the same, the materials are the same. What changes is the postcode and the overheads that come with it.

## Why Only Four Implants Can Hold an Entire Jaw of Teeth

This is genuinely fascinating, and it's one of those things that sounds too good to be true until you understand the engineering.

Each [implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) fuses with your jawbone over 3-6 months through something called osseointegration. Your bone literally grows into the titanium surface at a microscopic level. Once that's happened, each implant can handle over 200 newtons of biting force, which is substantial.

The clever part is what happens with the rear implants. In the All-on-4 technique, the two back implants are tilted at 30-45 degrees rather than going straight down. This does two brilliant things at once: the angled implant grips up to 50% more bone surface than a straight one, and it avoids the sinus cavities in the upper jaw and the nerve canal in the lower jaw. That tilt is the reason most people don't need bone grafts, which would otherwise add months and thousands of pounds to the whole thing.

And the bridge across the top distributes force across all four points. Think of it like a table: four legs, each placed strategically, holds just as much weight as one with eight legs placed randomly. It's better engineering rather than more materials.

At the 10-year mark, a meta-analysis led by researchers at Oxford and Liverpool found implant survival sitting at 96.4%. That's a remarkable number for something permanent in your body. Full-arch solutions perform similarly when placed by experienced surgeons.

## What the Process Actually Looks Like

This is something worth knowing upfront, because full mouth implants aren't a single appointment. The whole thing spans about 4-9 months from the first conversation to the final teeth, and understanding the stages takes the mystery out of it.

It starts with a consultation. CT scans, photos, impressions. The treatment gets planned digitally, and some practices charge £200-£500 for this stage while others fold it into the total.

Then comes surgery day. Any remaining teeth come out, the implants go in, and here's the part that surprises a lot of people: you walk out with teeth that same day. Temporary ones, made of acrylic, but fully functional. You're not going toothless while things heal. You're eating dinner that evening (something soft, but still).

The next 3-6 months are the quiet bit. Osseointegration is happening beneath the gum, and you're living your life with your temporary teeth. Eating, smiling, going about things normally. Regular check-ups keep an eye on how the integration is going.

Then the final stage: new impressions, bite registration, shade matching. The permanent teeth get crafted. They're fitted, adjusted, polished. And that's it. That's your new smile.

## How This Compares to the Other Options

The real question isn't just "how much do implants cost?" It's what does life look like afterwards compared to the alternatives.

A quality set of [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk) for both jaws runs £2,000-£5,000. Dramatically cheaper upfront, yes. But dentures need replacing every 5-10 years. They need adhesive. They need relining. And the jawbone underneath them gradually shrinks over time because there's nothing in it to signal it to maintain itself. Over 20 years, a good set of dentures costs £8,000-£20,000 in replacements and adjustments, and the jaw keeps changing shape.

Implants preserve the jawbone. The titanium roots do exactly what natural tooth roots do: they tell the bone to stay put. Twenty years from now, the jaw looks the same as it does today. When you look at [the long-term picture](/blog/dentures-vs-implants-costs), the gap between dentures and implants is a lot closer than the upfront price suggests.

## What About Paying for It All?

Nobody has £25,000 set aside in a "just in case I need new teeth" fund. That's just the reality.

Most implant clinics offer finance that spreads the cost over 2-5 years. Interest-free plans exist at many practices for 12-24 months. Longer terms of 3-5 years carry interest (typically 9-15% APR), which adds to the total, but it does make the monthly figure much more manageable.

On a £25,000 treatment, monthly payments look roughly like this:

| Finance term | Monthly payment | Total cost |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 12 months (0% interest) | £2,083 | £25,000 |
| 24 months (0% interest) | £1,042 | £25,000 |
| 36 months (9.9% APR) | ~£800 | ~£28,800 |
| 60 months (14.9% APR) | ~£595 | ~£35,700 |

Some people split things into phases too, doing one jaw at a time to spread the cost out.

## When Implants Need a Bit More Groundwork

Implants need bone to anchor into. If years of missing teeth or [gum disease](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) have left the jawbone thinner than it needs to be, bone grafting might be part of the picture. That adds £1,500-£4,000 per graft site and 4-6 months of extra healing.

Some health conditions change the timeline too: uncontrolled diabetes, active cancer treatment, heavy smoking. None of these are absolute no-go's, but they're things that need to be part of the conversation.

And for people with significant bone loss who'd rather avoid grafting altogether, there's a middle ground worth knowing about. Implant-retained [dentures](/blog/dentures-vs-implants-costs) use two to four implants per jaw to anchor a denture that clips on and off. The cost sits at £8,000-£15,000 per jaw, and the stability is a world apart from conventional dentures.

## The Number That Matters

Full mouth dental implants in the UK cost £20,000-£40,000 for both jaws. All-on-4 with acrylic teeth sits at the lower end. All-on-6 with zirconia sits at the upper end. Individual implants for a full mouth push past £50,000 and are rarely the recommended route.

The thing we keep hearing from patients at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) is that it's so much less than they expected. Eight implants, two jaws, a complete set of fixed teeth. The engineering is genuinely brilliant, and it means the price doesn't have to be terrifying. For a lot of people, that changes everything.
