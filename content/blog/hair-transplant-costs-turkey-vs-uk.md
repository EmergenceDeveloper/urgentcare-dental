So you've been looking at Turkey. And only because it's cheaper, right?

Everyone does. You see those prices - £1,500, £2,000 for a full head of hair - and something lifts in your chest. Finally, a price that isn't quite so eye watering.

But do you know what else is not so eye watering? The actual prices of having it done _inside_ the UK nowadays, with us.

We do hair transplants in Leeds for £2,500.

With Turkey, once you add the flights, you're at £2,700 minimum. Usually closer to £3,000 or £3,500 for a reputable clinic with good reviews. That makes it _more_ expensive than we charge.

Of course, reputable Turkish clinics do excellent work. Thousands of British men fly out every year and come back delighted.

But if, like it is for almost everyone, the main reason you're looking at Turkey is the price, then it's no doubt an absolute relief to know that there are options back at home nowadays.

For our £2,500 price, that's 3,500 to 4,000 grafts. FUE technique. PRP therapy included. Full aftercare kit. Twelve months of follow-up appointments. The whole thing.

No flights. No hotel. No navigating Istanbul airports with a tender scalp and a headful of tiny incisions. You drive in, we do the procedure, you drive home. Sleep in your own bed that night.

And this is UK-regulated healthcare. CQC standards. GMC-registered surgeons. Full legal protections. The whole framework that exists specifically so you're not "pulling your hair out," so to speak, over a potential nightmare if anything were to go wrong over in Turkey.

## Yes, We're a Dental Practice. No, the Dentists Aren't Doing Your Hair Transplant

We get it. "UrgentCare Dental" doesn't exactly scream "hair restoration specialists."

But here's the thing: we work with dedicated hair transplant surgeons who specialise in exactly this. The procedure is carried out by experts whose entire focus is FUE hair restoration. Our dental team handles teeth. Our hair transplant team handles hair. Different specialists, same commitment to quality, same building.

And actually, there's something rather fitting about it.

Back in the day - we're talking 1540 all the way through to 1745 - dentistry and hair care were done by the same people. The barber-surgeons. One guild, handling everything from tooth extractions to haircuts to minor surgery. They were essentially the GPs of their time. You'd pop in for a shave, get a tooth pulled, maybe have a boil lanced while you were at it. Full service.

The professions only split apart in 1745 when the surgeons decided they wanted their own fancy college.

So in a way, a dental practice offering hair transplants isn't strange at all. It's just history coming full circle. Three centuries later, and here we are - teeth and hair, back under one roof.

Maybe it's the future. At the very least, it makes sense - hair restoration fits right alongside the aesthetic work we already do in dentistry. [Smile makeovers](/blog/smile-makeover-costs), [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), veneers. It's all about helping people feel confident in how they look. Hair's just the next piece of that puzzle.

## What the First Week Actually Looks Like

The week after a hair transplant is when everything matters most.

Your scalp is covered in thousands of tiny grafts, each one a hair follicle finding its new home. They're delicate. They need time to settle in and establish blood supply. And during that window, questions come up.

Is this redness normal? Should it feel this tight? There's a little swelling around my forehead - is that okay?

With a Turkish clinic, you get WhatsApp support. Which genuinely does work well for most things. You send a photo, someone gets back to you, they tell you it's fine or they tell you what to do.

But there's a specific kind of reassurance that comes from being able to physically walk into the clinic where you had the procedure. Having the actual surgeon who operated on you take a look. Not a photo on a screen. Your actual scalp, under proper lighting, examined by someone who knows exactly what they did and what they're looking at.

That's worth something. Maybe not a measurable amount in pounds, but if you've ever been anxious about a medical thing and just wanted someone qualified to _look_ at it properly, you know exactly what we mean.

## The Numbers That Actually Matter

Here's a thing most people don't realise about hair transplants: the number of grafts transplanted isn't the number of grafts that survive.

Graft survival rate is what determines your actual results. A procedure that transplants 4,000 grafts with 70% survival gives you 2,800 living follicles. A procedure with 3,500 grafts and 95% survival gives you 3,325.

More hair from fewer grafts. That's what quality technique delivers.

At UrgentCare Dental, we achieve 95-98% graft survival rates. That's right at the top of what's possible with current FUE techniques. The Turkish clinics with the best reputations report similar numbers. But the high-volume budget clinics? The ones advertising the very lowest prices? Their survival rates often sit considerably lower.

This is where cheap becomes expensive. A £1,500 procedure with poor graft survival might leave you booking a second procedure to fill in the gaps. At that point, you've spent more than you would have just doing it properly the first time.

## Real Results From Real People

We could talk all day about graft survival rates and technique. But honestly? Pictures do the talking better than we ever could.

Head over to our [hair transplant page](/hair-transplants) and have a look at the before and after sliders, or you can see some of just the _after_ photos in the collage image right at the start of this post. These are actual patients. Real hair loss patterns, real procedures, real results.

You'll see blokes who came in with significant recession walking out with full, natural hairlines. The kind of results where their mates probably just think they've started styling it differently. That's the goal - hair that looks like it's always been there.

## What's Actually Included

Let's break down what £2,500 at [UrgentCare Dental](/hair-transplants) gets you, because the details matter:

The procedure itself covers 3,500 to 4,000 grafts using the FUE technique. That's enough for most people to fully restore their hairline and get solid coverage across the top. For more advanced hair loss, we'll tell you honestly whether that's achievable in one session or whether you'd need to think about it differently.

PRP therapy comes included. That's platelet-rich plasma treatment, which supports healing and encourages stronger growth from your transplanted follicles. Most clinics charge £300-500 for this as an add-on. We just include it.

You get a complete aftercare kit with everything you need for recovery. Specialised shampoo, healing solutions, detailed instructions. Not a leaflet and a wave goodbye.

And then there's twelve months of follow-up. That's not twelve months of "call us if something goes wrong." It's scheduled check-ins, progress reviews, and ongoing access to the team who did your procedure. We want to see how it's developing just as much as you do.

## The Consultation Is Free

If you're weighing this up and you want to know what your specific situation would look like, we offer [free 30-minute video consultations](/hair-transplants) every Monday evening from 6pm to 10pm.

No pressure. No hard sell. Just an honest conversation about your hair loss pattern, what results you can realistically expect, and what the process would involve.

You might decide Turkey still makes sense for you. Maybe you fancy the trip, or you've found a specific surgeon whose work you love. Genuinely, that's fine.

But if price was the main reason you were looking abroad, and you'd actually rather have it done locally if the numbers made sense - now you know they do.

Book a consultation and let's talk about what's possible for you.
