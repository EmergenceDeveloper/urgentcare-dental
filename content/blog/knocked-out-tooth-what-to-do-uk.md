A ball to the face during five-a-side. An elbow at a gig. A toddler's head swinging back at exactly the wrong angle. A stumble on wet pavement. One moment you have all your teeth, and the next you're looking at one of them in your hand, roots and all, and your mouth is filling with blood, and the world has gone very quiet and very loud at the same time.

A knocked-out tooth is one of those things that feels catastrophic in the moment. The blood, the gap, the raw socket where a tooth used to be. Your tongue keeps going to the space and finding nothing and it's deeply, viscerally wrong.

Here's what makes this different from almost every other dental emergency: time matters. Really matters. In a way that turns minutes into the difference between keeping your tooth and losing it permanently. And the window is more generous than you'd think.

## The Science That Makes This Possible

A knocked-out permanent tooth can be put back in. Reimplanted. Back in its socket, where it heals and functions as if nothing happened. That sounds too good to be true, and yet it's one of the most well-documented procedures in emergency dentistry.

The reason it works comes down to something called the periodontal ligament. It's a thin layer of living tissue that coats the root surface of every tooth, connecting the tooth to the bone. When a tooth gets knocked clean out, that ligament comes with it. And here's the remarkable part: as long as those ligament cells are still alive when the tooth goes back in, they can reattach. The tooth re-anchors itself. Bone regrows around it. Within a few weeks, it's stable. Within a few months, it's as if the whole thing never happened.

The cells on that ligament surface are what everything hinges on. They're alive when the tooth comes out, and they stay alive for a while afterwards, suspended in whatever environment the tooth ends up in. The question is: how long?

If the tooth goes back into its socket within 15 minutes, success rates are extraordinary. Over 90%. The ligament cells barely had time to notice they'd left.

Within 30 minutes, the rates are still excellent. The cells are stressed but viable. Reimplantation works the vast majority of the time.

After 30 minutes, things start changing. The cells begin to die, and once they're gone, they're gone. The tooth can still be reimplanted after 60 minutes, but the long-term prognosis drops. The body may gradually resorb the root over a period of years, a slow process called replacement resorption that eventually means losing the tooth anyway.

After two hours of the tooth sitting dry, the chances of successful reimplantation drop dramatically. The ligament cells are no longer viable, and the tooth, if reimplanted, is essentially acting as a space-holder rather than a truly reintegrated living tooth.

Fifteen minutes. Thirty minutes. That's the window. And what happens during those minutes matters enormously.

## The Milk Thing

This is the part that sounds like an old wives' tale but is backed by serious research.

If a knocked-out tooth goes into a glass of cold milk, the periodontal ligament cells survive dramatically longer than if the tooth is left dry. A 2020 study found that storing an avulsed tooth in milk reduced the loss rate of reimplanted teeth by 56% compared to teeth kept dry. Milk's pH and osmolality are remarkably similar to the conditions inside your mouth. It's not perfect, but it's an extraordinary temporary environment for keeping those cells alive.

Saline solution works too, and slightly better than milk. But saline isn't something most people have in their kitchen when a tooth gets knocked out at Sunday lunch. Milk is.

Water, interestingly, is worse than milk. The osmolality is wrong; tap water causes the ligament cells to swell and burst faster than if the tooth were just left in air. So a tooth in a glass of water is actually losing viability faster than one wrapped in cling film.

The absolute best option is the simplest one: put the tooth back in yourself. Right there, on the sports pitch or in the kitchen. Hold it by the crown (the white part, never the root), give it a gentle rinse under cold water if it's dirty, and push it back into the socket. It'll feel strange, and it might hurt, and there'll be blood. But the tooth is back where the ligament cells want to be, bathed in your own saliva, at exactly the right temperature and pH. Nothing comes close to this for preserving viability.

Then get to a dentist. As fast as reasonably possible, but knowing that the tooth is back in its socket and every passing minute is working in your favour rather than against you.

## What the Dentist Does

The emergency appointment for a reimplanted tooth is focused and efficient.

If the tooth is already back in the socket (either because someone put it back at the scene or the dentist reimplants it in the chair), it gets splinted. A thin flexible wire is bonded across the reimplanted tooth and the teeth either side of it, holding everything stable while the periodontal ligament heals and the tooth re-anchors. The splint stays on for about two weeks. It's visible if you look for it, but not uncomfortable.

An X-ray checks that the tooth is in the right position and that nothing else is damaged: no fractures in the surrounding bone, no damage to neighbouring teeth.

Antibiotics are usually part of the plan, to prevent infection in the healing socket. And a tetanus check might come up if the tooth hit the ground, though that's a GP conversation rather than a dental one.

Follow-up appointments happen at one week, two weeks (when the splint comes off), one month, three months, six months, and a year. That sounds like a lot of visits, but each one is quick: a look, an X-ray, a check that the tooth is alive and stable. The dentist is watching for signs of resorption or nerve death, both of which can be managed if caught early.

An [emergency dental appointment](/blog/emergency-dental-treatment-costs-uk) for reimplantation at a private practice in the UK runs £50-£200 for the emergency slot, plus the cost of the splinting and X-rays. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), emergency appointments start at just [£20](/pricing).

## When the Tooth Can't Be Saved

Sometimes the window closes. The tooth was out too long, or it's damaged beyond what reimplantation can fix. A tooth that's broken vertically through the root, or one where the socket itself is badly fractured, may not be a candidate for reimplantation regardless of timing.

That's a genuinely difficult moment. Looking at a gap in your smile that's going to stay there, at least for now. But "for now" is the key phrase, because the options for replacing a knocked-out tooth are genuinely excellent.

A [dental implant](/blog/single-tooth-implant-cost-uk) is the closest thing to getting your original tooth back. A titanium root goes into the jawbone, fuses with it over 3-6 months, and a crown goes on top that looks and functions identically to a natural tooth. At UrgentCare Dental, a single implant costs [£1,999](/pricing). Across the UK, single implants range from £1,500-£3,500.

The timing for an implant after trauma depends on how the socket heals. Sometimes an implant can be placed relatively soon. Sometimes the bone needs time to recover first, or even a small graft to rebuild what was damaged. The dentist maps all of this out based on how the area is healing.

A dental bridge is the other common option, spanning the gap by anchoring to the teeth either side. Bridges run £700-£1,500 and last 10-15 years. For a single missing tooth, especially in the visible front of the mouth, a bridge can look seamless.

And for the interim period while things heal and a permanent solution gets planned? A temporary denture, sometimes called a flipper, fills the gap cosmetically. It clips in and out, it looks natural enough for photos and work, and it costs £200-£500. Nobody needs to walk around with a gap while waiting for their implant.

## Children's Teeth: A Different Story

Everything above applies to permanent adult teeth. Baby teeth are a completely different situation, and it's worth knowing the difference because dental trauma peaks in children aged 7-12, right when they have a mix of baby teeth and adult teeth in their mouths.

A knocked-out baby tooth should not be reimplanted. Pushing a baby tooth back into its socket risks damaging the developing permanent tooth underneath. The baby tooth was going to fall out anyway; it's just happened sooner and more dramatically than planned.

A knocked-out adult tooth in a child's mouth is treated the same way as in an adult: reimplant it as quickly as possible, splint it, monitor the healing. The success rates in children are actually slightly better than in adults, because the blood supply to the area is typically stronger in younger patients.

The tricky part is telling the difference in a panicked moment. Baby teeth tend to be smaller, whiter, and have shorter roots. If there's any uncertainty, getting to a dentist fast covers both scenarios, and the dentist sorts out which type of tooth it is.

## The Numbers on Dental Trauma

Dental trauma is more common than most people realise. About 5% of all A&E attendances include some form of dental injury. Sports are the leading cause, particularly contact sports like rugby, football, hockey, and martial arts. Falls are second. And then there's the miscellaneous category: car accidents, collisions with other people, and the surprisingly common "walked into something."

The upper front teeth are involved in over 80% of dental trauma cases. They protrude slightly, they're the first thing to hit, and they're the most visible when damaged. There's a cruel efficiency to how dental trauma targets the teeth that matter most to your smile.

Mouthguards reduce the risk of dental trauma by up to 82%. A custom-fitted one from a dentist costs £50-£150 and lasts several years. That's a meaningful number when you consider that replacing a knocked-out front tooth with an implant costs £1,999. The mouthguard is the cheapest insurance policy in sport.

## The Moment That Changes the Timeline

There's a very specific moment in a dental trauma emergency that determines everything. It's the moment between the tooth being knocked out and something happening about it.

In that moment, someone picks up the tooth by the crown (never the root), rinses it gently, and either reimplants it or drops it in milk. The clock that started when the tooth left its socket slows down. The ligament cells, the ones that make the whole miracle of reimplantation possible, get a fighting chance.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), we see reimplanted teeth that are still healthy years after the original trauma. Teeth that were knocked out on a football pitch and put back in by a teammate. Teeth that sat in a glass of milk on a panicked car journey to the practice. Each one of them is a small, quiet victory: a gap that didn't happen, a smile that stayed intact, because someone knew about the window and used it.

Thirty minutes. That's all it takes. The tooth in milk, the phone call to an emergency dentist, and a window that stays wide open.
