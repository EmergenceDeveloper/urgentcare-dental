The word "braces" does a remarkable amount of heavy lifting. It covers four completely different treatment systems, at four completely different price points, with four totally different experiences of what it's like to live with them. The price range runs from about £1,500 to £10,000, which is wildly wide, and the reason it's so wide is almost beautiful in its simplicity: the architecture of the problem determines the architecture of the solution.

A few crowded teeth on one arch? That's a gentle, short course of treatment. Severe bite problems across both arches, teeth rotated and tipped and interlocked in complex ways? That's a multi-year project involving some of the most precise biomechanics in all of dentistry. Barely the same procedure.

Here's what each type actually costs, and what's really going on with each one.

## Metal Braces: £1,500-£3,000

The original. Metal brackets bonded to each tooth, connected by a metal archwire that applies slow, constant pressure. The orthodontist adjusts the wire every few weeks, and the teeth, responding to that pressure, gradually remodel the bone around their roots and drift into position. It sounds simple. The physics underneath it are extraordinary.

Metal braces remain the most versatile system in orthodontics. They handle everything: crowding, spacing, rotations, overbites, underbites, crossbites, open bites, the full catalogue. When a case is too complex for any other system, metal braces can still manage it. The range of movement they can achieve is wider than any alternative, which is why they're still the gold standard for difficult orthodontics.

They're also the most affordable, and the reason for that is interesting: not because they're inferior, but because the technology is mature. Decades of refinement have made the materials cost-effective and the protocols highly efficient. Lower price, same outcomes. The only real trade-off is visibility. Metal brackets on the front surfaces of the teeth are visible when you smile, speak, eat. For adults, that visibility is often the deciding factor, not the cost.

Treatment runs 12-24 months for most cases.

## Ceramic Braces: £2,000-£5,500

Same mechanical system as metal braces, but the brackets are made from tooth-coloured ceramic that blends with the natural tooth shade. The archwire can also be coated to reduce visibility. From a conversational distance, ceramic braces are surprisingly hard to spot.

The premium over metal reflects the material cost (ceramic is more expensive to manufacture and more demanding to work with because it's more brittle). But functionally, ceramic braces do essentially the same job as metal braces, with the same range of movement and the same treatment timelines. The limitations are minor: in the most extreme cases, the forces needed might exceed what ceramic brackets can withstand. For the vast majority of cases, identical outcomes, much better aesthetics.

One quirk worth knowing: the elastic ties that hold the wire to the brackets can stain between adjustment appointments. Coffee, tea, red wine, curry, turmeric: the usual suspects. The ties are replaced at each visit, so it resets every time, but the gradual discolouration between visits is noticeable.

Treatment duration: 12-24 months, same as metal.

## Lingual Braces: £2,000-£10,000

And now something genuinely clever. Lingual braces work exactly like conventional braces: brackets, wires, the same biomechanical principles. But the brackets are bonded to the back surfaces of the teeth, behind them, on the tongue side. From the front, completely invisible. Nobody can tell they're there.

The price range is the widest of any system, and the reason is the sheer spectrum of options: semi-custom systems at the lower end, fully bespoke systems (each bracket individually designed and milled for the specific geometry of the patient's tooth) at the upper end. Fully customised lingual systems are remarkable pieces of engineering: precision-manufactured hardware contoured to fit surfaces that are, by nature, irregular and hard to access.

Fewer orthodontists offer lingual braces. The technique is more demanding: the tongue side of the teeth is tighter, less visible, harder to work in. Adjustments take longer. Placement requires specialised training. That scarcity of providers, combined with the complexity, contributes to the higher price.

Living with lingual braces feels different too. The tongue contacts the brackets, which causes initial soreness and a temporary lisp as the tongue learns to navigate around the hardware. Most patients adapt within two to four weeks. After that, the braces essentially disappear: invisible to everyone else, and barely noticeable to the wearer.

## Clear Aligners: £1,500-£5,500

A series of custom-made, transparent plastic trays that fit over the teeth like a very thin mouthguard. Each tray moves the teeth a fraction of a millimetre. The patient wears each tray for one to two weeks, then switches to the next one in the series. No brackets. No wires. Removable for eating, drinking, and cleaning. Nearly invisible when worn.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [clear aligners start at £2,999](/pricing).

The evolution of clear aligners over the past decade has been dramatic. Early systems could handle mild crowding and that was about it. Current systems manage moderate crowding, spacing, certain bite corrections, and rotations that would have been unthinkable for aligners ten years ago. The technology keeps advancing. Severe cases, significant bite problems, and the most complex tooth movements still require bracket-and-wire systems, but the boundary keeps moving.

The appeal is obvious and powerful: nearly invisible, comfortable (smooth plastic, nothing to irritate the cheeks), and lifestyle-friendly. Eating is unrestricted because the trays come out for meals. Oral hygiene is normal because you brush and floss without hardware in the way.

The catch: they only work if they're worn. Twenty to twenty-two hours a day is the requirement. Out for meals and cleaning, in for everything else. Patients who consistently under-wear their aligners see slower progress, or the treatment stalls entirely and needs re-planning. Clear aligners are a partnership between the technology and the patient's commitment to wearing them.

Treatment duration: 6-18 months for most cases.

## What Actually Drives the Price

The cost within each system's range comes down to a few factors, and they're worth understanding because they explain why two patients getting the "same" treatment can receive very different quotes.

Complexity is the biggest driver. The more tooth movement required, the more appointments, the more materials, the longer the treatment. An eight-month case costs less than a twenty-four-month case because it simply involves less of everything: less clinical time, fewer adjustments, fewer wires or trays.

Geography matters. London and the South East carry higher fees across the board. A specialist orthodontist (a dentist who completed additional years of dedicated orthodontic training after dental school) charges more than a general dentist with orthodontic experience. For complex cases, that specialist training makes a real difference. For straightforward alignment, a skilled general dentist delivers excellent results.

Retention is the part people forget to ask about. After the braces come off, retainers maintain the result: either fixed wires bonded behind the front teeth, or removable clear trays worn at night, or both. Some treatment fees include retention. Some charge separately (£100-£400 per retainer). Worth clarifying before treatment begins, because retention isn't optional: without it, the teeth can drift back toward their original positions.

## Choosing Between Them

Complex cases: metal or ceramic braces. The bracket-and-wire system achieves three-dimensional tooth movement with a precision that current aligner technology approaches but doesn't quite match in every scenario.

Moderate cases where aesthetics matter: clear aligners or ceramic braces. Both work brilliantly, both are discreet. The choice often comes down to personality: do you prefer removable (the flexibility of taking them out for a photo or a meal) or fixed (nothing to remember, nothing to lose, always working)?

Complete invisibility: lingual braces. The only truly invisible option, at a premium, with the tongue-adaptation period.

Mild to moderate on a budget: metal braces or entry-level clear aligner systems. Both deliver excellent results for straightforward alignment at the most accessible price points.

## The Assessment

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the orthodontic assessment identifies what movement is needed, which systems can achieve it, and what the cost and timeline look like for each option. [Clear aligners at £2,999](/pricing) cover a wide range of mild to moderate cases.

For patients thinking about [cosmetic improvements](/blog/cosmetic-dentistry-options-uk) to their smile, orthodontics is often the foundation: straighten the teeth first, then refine with [whitening](/blog/teeth-whitening-cost-uk), [bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), or [veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk). The straight teeth make everything else work better.

The smile you're imagining starts with understanding what's possible. That's what the assessment is for.
