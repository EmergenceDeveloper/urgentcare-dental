The NHS dental price list looks, on paper, like an extraordinary deal. £27.40 for a check-up. £75.30 for fillings, root canals, or extractions. £326.70 for crowns, bridges, or dentures. Three simple bands covering virtually everything in dentistry, at prices that make private dental fees look outrageous by comparison.

The paper is not where most people's experience lives though.

The reality of NHS dentistry in [YEAR] is this: finding an NHS dentist who's accepting new patients is, for millions of people across the UK, functionally impossible. The British Dental Association reports that more than 10 million people were unable to access NHS dental care in the past year. Some areas of the country have zero NHS practices taking new adult patients. Zero.

Which means the NHS price list, as attractive as it is, has become largely theoretical for anyone who doesn't already have an NHS dentist. And that changes the nature of the comparison entirely. It's no longer "do you prefer cheap or expensive?" It's "what can you actually access, and what does it cost?"

## The NHS Price Bands

Understanding the NHS system helps even if you can't access it, because the band structure is genuinely unusual.

Band 1 costs £27.40. This covers a dental examination, diagnosis, X-rays, a scale and polish (if clinically needed), preventative care like fluoride varnish, and advice. It's an assessment appointment, essentially.

Band 2 costs £75.30. This covers everything in Band 1 plus treatment: fillings, root canals, extractions. The critical point: it doesn't matter how many fillings you need. One filling or seven fillings, it's £75.30. The band fee covers a course of treatment, not individual procedures.

Band 3 costs £326.70. This covers everything in Bands 1 and 2 plus crowns, bridges, and dentures. Again, a single course of treatment: one crown or three crowns, same price.

Emergency appointments fall under Band 1 at £27.40 for emergency assessment and pain relief.

The band system means that NHS patients with multiple problems in one course of treatment get remarkable value. Seven fillings for £75.30 would cost £700-£1,750 privately. A full set of dentures for £326.70 would cost £2,000-£5,000 privately.

## What Private Dental Care Costs

[Private dental pricing](/blog/private-dentist-prices-uk) is itemised: you pay for each individual procedure.

A private check-up and examination costs £50-£120. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), examinations are competitively priced.

A private filling costs £99-£300 depending on size and tooth. At UrgentCare Dental, [fillings start at £99](/pricing).

A private extraction costs £100-£300. [Wisdom teeth cost £549](/pricing).

A private [root canal](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk) costs £300-£700. A [dental crown](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk) costs £500-£1,000.

For someone needing a single check-up and one small filling, the private cost might be £150-£300 compared to £75.30 on the NHS. The difference is meaningful but manageable.

For someone needing multiple fillings, a root canal, and a crown, the private cost can reach £1,000-£2,000 compared to £326.70 for the whole course on the NHS. That's a substantial gap.

## What the Price Difference Actually Buys

The numbers favour the NHS decisively on cost. So what does private dentistry offer that justifies the higher prices for the millions of people who use it by choice, not just necessity?

Availability is the biggest practical difference. A private practice takes your call, books you in, and sees you. No waiting lists, no "not accepting new patients," no geographic lottery of whether your area has NHS provision. You call, you're seen, typically within days for routine appointments and the same day for emergencies.

At UrgentCare Dental, [emergency appointments are £20](/pricing) and available the same day. The NHS equivalent is theoretically £27.40 but finding an NHS emergency slot can involve hours on the phone, calls to 111, and appointments that may not happen until the following day.

Material choices are broader in private care. NHS fillings are functional and clinically appropriate, but private practices offer premium composite materials with better colour matching and potentially better longevity. Crowns on the NHS are limited to specific materials, while private patients can choose from a range of ceramics, zirconia, and layered porcelain options.

Appointment length is typically longer in private care. An NHS check-up might be 10-15 minutes. A private check-up is often 20-30 minutes, with more time for discussion, examination, and treatment planning. The pace is less pressured.

Continuity of care tends to be stronger in private practice. You see the same dentist at each visit, building a relationship and a treatment history. NHS practices, particularly in areas with recruitment challenges, may have higher staff turnover.

Cosmetic treatments are almost exclusively private. [Teeth whitening](/blog/teeth-whitening-cost-uk), [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), [veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk), and [clear aligners](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) aren't available on the NHS (they're classified as cosmetic rather than clinical), so anyone wanting these treatments is paying private prices regardless.

## The Access Crisis

This is the elephant in the room of any NHS vs private comparison: the comparison assumes both options are available, and for a growing number of people in the UK, the NHS option simply isn't.

The dental access crisis has been building for years and accelerated significantly during the pandemic. NHS contract terms make it financially difficult for practices to offer NHS care, and many have reduced or ended their NHS commitments in favour of private work. The result is a patchwork system where some areas have reasonable NHS provision and others have virtually none.

For new patients trying to register with an NHS dentist in [YEAR], the experience is often a series of phone calls to practices that aren't accepting patients, calls to 111 that result in long waits and limited options, and ultimately a realisation that private dentistry is the available path.

This isn't a policy commentary. It's a practical reality that shapes the decision for millions of people. The choice between NHS and private has, for many, become a choice between private and nothing.

## The Hybrid Approach

Some patients use a mix of NHS and private care, and this can be a cost-effective strategy where it's possible.

Routine check-ups and basic treatment on the NHS (£27.40 for Band 1, £75.30 for Band 2) keep the baseline costs low. Cosmetic work, complex treatments, or emergency care that's faster and more accessible goes private.

This works well when you have an existing NHS dentist for the basics. It's less relevant if you can't access NHS care at all, which circles back to the availability problem.

Some private practices offer membership plans that change the economics. A typical plan costs £15-£30 per month and includes two check-ups, two hygiene sessions, and discounted treatment. Over a year, you're paying £180-£360 for preventive care that would cost £200-£400 if paid per appointment. The plan also typically includes discounted emergency access and reduced treatment fees.

## Making the Numbers Work

For someone currently without a dentist (NHS or private), the private dental cost picture is the relevant one. Here's how to think about it practically.

Preventive care is the most cost-effective dental spending. Two check-ups and two hygiene sessions per year, at £50-£120 each, run £200-£480 annually. That investment catches problems when they're small and cheap to fix (a £99 filling) rather than waiting until they're large and expensive (a £700 root canal plus £650 crown).

[Emergency appointments at £20](/pricing) at UrgentCare Dental remove the financial barrier to being seen when something goes wrong. The most expensive dental problem is the one that goes untreated because the appointment fee was a deterrent.

[Payment plans](/blog/dental-implant-payment-plans-uk) and dental finance options spread the cost of larger treatments. A treatment that costs £500 upfront becomes manageable at £40-£80 per month.

The overall annual cost of private dental care for someone with healthy teeth who attends regularly is £200-£500: the check-ups, cleanings, and the occasional small filling. It's more than the NHS, but it's less than most people assume, and it's a fraction of what dental problems cost when they're left to accumulate.

## The Honest Comparison

NHS dental care, where you can get it, offers extraordinary value. The band pricing system means even complex treatment courses are capped at modest levels. If you have an NHS dentist, maintaining that relationship makes financial sense for routine and basic care.

Private dental care costs more per item but offers immediate access, broader material and treatment choices, longer appointments, and availability that doesn't depend on geographic luck. For [cosmetic treatments](/blog/cosmetic-dentistry-options-uk), private is the only option.

The real comparison in [YEAR] isn't purely about price. It's about what's available. And for millions of people across the UK, private dental care isn't the expensive alternative to the NHS. It's the available alternative to nothing.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the approach is simple: make private dental care as affordable and accessible as possible. [£20 emergency appointments](/pricing). [£99 fillings](/pricing). [£299 composite bonding](/pricing). Prices that close the gap between NHS and private, in a practice that's actually taking patients.

Because the best dental care, at any price point, is the dental care you can actually get.
