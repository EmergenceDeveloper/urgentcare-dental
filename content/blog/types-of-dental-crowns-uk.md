The dentist has said you need a crown, and now a second question follows: what kind? Because crowns come in different materials, each with distinct strengths, and the choice affects how the crown looks, how long it lasts, and what it costs.

The good news is that all modern crown materials work well. The days when crown selection was a significant gamble are gone. Today's materials are predictably excellent, and the differences between them are more about optimisation than compromise: choosing the best material for the specific tooth, the specific location, and the specific demands that tooth faces.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), [dental crowns are £650](/pricing). The material choice is part of the consultation, guided by which tooth needs crowning and what will deliver the best long-term result.

## Porcelain (All-Ceramic) Crowns

Porcelain crowns are made entirely from ceramic material, with no metal core. They're the most aesthetically pleasing crown type: the ceramic can be layered in different opacities and shades to replicate the translucency, depth, and colour variation of natural enamel.

Light passes through a porcelain crown the way it passes through a natural tooth. This translucency is what makes them look real. In the right light, a well-made porcelain crown is indistinguishable from the natural teeth around it.

**Best for:** Front teeth and premolars where aesthetics matter. Any tooth that shows when you smile.

**Strength:** Good, but not the strongest option. All-ceramic crowns can chip or fracture under heavy biting forces, particularly if the patient [grinds their teeth](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions). Modern ceramics (lithium disilicate, specifically) are significantly stronger than earlier porcelain materials, but they're still not the first choice for a molar that takes the full force of chewing.

**Longevity:** 10-15 years typically, with many lasting longer. The weak point is usually chipping at the edges rather than catastrophic failure.

**Cost:** £400-£800 across the UK. [£650 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

## Zirconia Crowns

Zirconia is the material that's changed crown dentistry over the last decade. It's a ceramic, technically (zirconium dioxide), but it behaves more like a very refined metal: enormously strong, highly wear-resistant, and biocompatible.

The strength numbers are striking. Zirconia has a flexural strength of 900-1,200 MPa, compared to 300-400 MPa for lithium disilicate porcelain and 100-150 MPa for traditional porcelain. In practical terms: a zirconia crown is almost impossible to break under normal biting forces. Fractures are rare enough to be case-study material.

Early zirconia crowns had an aesthetic limitation: they were opaque. That bright, uniform whiteness that looked obviously artificial, like a tooth made of bathroom tile. Modern zirconia has addressed this dramatically. Multi-layered zirconia blanks now incorporate translucency gradients that mimic natural enamel, with more opaque dentin shades at the base and translucent enamel shades at the biting edge.

The result is a crown that combines the strength of zirconia with aesthetics that approach (though don't quite match) all-ceramic crowns. For most teeth, modern zirconia is visually indistinguishable from the natural teeth around it.

**Best for:** Molars and premolars where strength is critical. Also increasingly used for front teeth, where the latest translucent zirconia provides both aesthetics and durability. Patients who grind their teeth benefit from zirconia's fracture resistance.

**Strength:** The strongest crown material available. Virtually fracture-proof under normal and even excessive biting forces.

**Longevity:** 15-20+ years. The material itself shows no signs of degradation within normal crown lifespans. Most zirconia crown replacements are due to changes in the surrounding tooth or gum rather than failure of the crown itself.

**Cost:** £500-£900 across the UK. Some practices charge a premium for zirconia; others price it the same as porcelain.

## Porcelain-Fused-to-Metal (PFM) Crowns

PFM crowns were the gold standard for decades: a metal core (usually a cobalt-chromium or gold alloy) covered with a layer of porcelain for aesthetics. The metal provides strength; the porcelain provides a natural tooth colour.

They work well. Millions of PFM crowns are in mouths across the UK right now, functioning perfectly after 10, 15, 20 years. The combination of metal strength and porcelain aesthetics was the best available option for most of modern dentistry's history.

The limitation is visible at the gum line. The metal core creates a dark shadow where the crown meets the gum, a greyish line that becomes more visible as gum tissue thins or recedes with age. On front teeth, this dark margin can be cosmetically significant. On back teeth, it's rarely noticed.

The other aesthetic limitation is light transmission. The metal core blocks light, preventing the translucency that makes all-ceramic and zirconia crowns look natural. A PFM crown looks like a tooth from arm's length, but up close, particularly in certain lighting, it lacks the depth and vitality of metal-free alternatives.

PFM crowns are gradually being superseded by zirconia, which offers comparable strength without the metal core and its associated aesthetic compromises. But PFM remains a valid option, and many dentists still use them for specific situations, particularly for long-span bridges where the metal framework provides structural support.

**Best for:** Back teeth where aesthetics are secondary to strength. Long-span bridges. Patients with strong bites who need maximum durability.

**Strength:** Excellent. The metal core is virtually unbreakable. The porcelain overlay can chip, but the underlying crown remains functional.

**Longevity:** 10-20 years. The metal core outlasts the porcelain; if the porcelain chips, it can sometimes be repaired without replacing the entire crown.

**Cost:** £400-£800 across the UK. Generally similar to all-ceramic crowns.

## Gold and Metal Alloy Crowns

Full metal crowns, particularly gold alloy crowns, have been used in dentistry for over a century. They're the least aesthetically appealing option (they look like metal, because they are metal), but they have properties that no other material matches.

Gold alloy has a wear rate almost identical to natural enamel. This matters because a crown that's harder than enamel (like zirconia or porcelain) can wear down the opposing tooth over time. Gold wears at the same rate as the tooth it bites against, creating a harmonious relationship between crown and opposing tooth that preserves both.

Gold crowns require the least tooth preparation: the metal can be made thinner than porcelain or zirconia while retaining its strength. Less tooth preparation means more natural tooth structure is preserved, which benefits the tooth's long-term health.

The fit of a gold crown is exceptional. The gold alloy can be burnished (shaped under pressure) to adapt intimately to the prepared tooth surface, creating a seal at the margin that's tighter than any other crown material achieves. This seal reduces the risk of bacteria getting between the crown and the tooth, which reduces the risk of decay under the crown.

**Best for:** Second and third molars (far back teeth) where aesthetics are irrelevant and function is everything. Patients who want the longest-lasting, most tooth-friendly crown available and don't mind the colour.

**Strength:** Excellent. Gold doesn't fracture. It flexes slightly under load and returns to shape, absorbing forces that would crack porcelain.

**Longevity:** 20-30+ years. Gold crowns routinely outlast every other crown type. Some gold crowns placed in the 1970s and 1980s are still functioning perfectly today.

**Cost:** £500-£1,200 across the UK, influenced by the current gold price. The precious metal content adds cost, but the longevity makes the cost-per-year calculation favourable.

## The Comparison Table

| Material | Aesthetics | Strength | Longevity | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Porcelain (all-ceramic) | Excellent | Good | 10-15 years | Front teeth |
| Zirconia | Very good | Excellent | 15-20+ years | Any tooth, especially back |
| PFM | Good | Very good | 10-20 years | Back teeth, bridges |
| Gold | Poor (metallic) | Excellent | 20-30+ years | Far back molars |

## What Determines the Choice

The tooth's position in the mouth is the primary factor. Front teeth need the best aesthetics. Back teeth need the best strength. Premolars sit in the middle and can go either way.

The patient's bite forces matter. Someone who [grinds their teeth](/blog/teeth-grinding-solutions) puts extraordinary stress on crowns, particularly during sleep. Zirconia or metal crowns handle this better than all-ceramic.

The amount of remaining tooth structure influences the choice. Teeth with minimal remaining structure benefit from materials that can be made thin (gold) or that bond chemically to the tooth (all-ceramic). Teeth with good remaining structure accommodate any material.

The opposing tooth matters. A crown that bites against a natural tooth ideally shouldn't be much harder than that tooth. Gold matches enamel's wear rate perfectly. Zirconia and porcelain are harder and can cause accelerated wear on opposing natural teeth, though modern formulations have reduced this issue significantly.

Allergies and sensitivities occasionally guide the choice. Metal allergies (nickel is the most common) rule out PFM crowns with nickel-containing alloys. All-ceramic and zirconia crowns are completely metal-free and hypoallergenic.

## The Procedure

Regardless of material, the crown procedure follows the same sequence.

The tooth is prepared by reshaping it under local anaesthetic: removing a layer of enamel and dentin to create space for the crown. The amount removed depends on the material (0.5-1.5mm for all-ceramic, less for gold). An impression or digital scan captures the prepared tooth. A temporary crown is placed while the permanent crown is made in a laboratory over 1-2 weeks.

At the second appointment, the temporary crown is removed, the permanent crown is tried in, adjusted for fit and bite, and cemented in place. The whole process, from preparation to final cementation, takes two visits about two weeks apart.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the [crown consultation](/pricing) covers the assessment, material recommendation, and cost. The £650 fee includes the full procedure: preparation, impression, temporary crown, and the permanent crown in the recommended material.

Every crown material in [YEAR] is a good choice. The best choice is the one matched to the specific tooth, the specific mouth, and the specific patient. That's the conversation that happens in the chair, with the X-ray on the screen and the options laid out clearly.
