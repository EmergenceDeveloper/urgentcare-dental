Here's something that might change how you think about this whole thing: one in five people getting their teeth straightened right now is over eighteen.

That's not a small number. That's a lot of adults quietly deciding that actually, yes, they are going to do something about their teeth. Finally.

And here's the other thing worth knowing upfront: it works just as well at thirty-five or forty-five or fifty-five as it does at fifteen. The process that moves teeth through bone doesn't care how many birthdays you've had. Teeth move when pressure is applied to them. That's it. That's the whole mechanism. It happens whether you're in school or running a business or retired.

The only real difference is that adult bones are denser, which means things take a little longer. We're talking months, not years of extra time. The results? Exactly the same.

So if you've been carrying around this quiet thought, maybe for years, that you'd like to do something about your teeth but you're probably too old now, or it's too late, or you should have done it when you were younger... you can let that one go.

## The Moment That Usually Brings People Here

There's a pattern to how adults end up researching teeth straightening. It tends to go something like this.

You've been aware of your teeth for a while. Maybe a long while. There's that one tooth that sits a bit forward, or the crowding at the bottom that's gotten gradually worse over the years. You notice it in photos. You might have developed a way of smiling that doesn't show your teeth too much, or a habit of covering your mouth when you laugh.

And then something happens. Sometimes it's a photo where you really notice it. Sometimes it's a work situation where you're suddenly doing video calls all day and you're staring at yourself on screen. Sometimes it's just reaching a certain age and thinking: actually, why am I still putting up with this?

Whatever the trigger, you start googling. And immediately you're overwhelmed by options. Invisalign. Clear aligners. Metal braces. Ceramic braces. Lingual braces. Terms like "comprehensive treatment" and "mild malocclusion" and price ranges that seem to span thousands of pounds.

So let's make this simpler.

## What Your Options Actually Are

The world of adult teeth straightening basically splits into two camps: things that are fixed to your teeth, and things you can take out.

**Fixed options** include traditional metal braces (the ones you remember from school), ceramic braces (same idea but tooth-coloured so they're less obvious), and lingual braces (fitted to the back of your teeth so they're completely hidden). Once they're on, they're on. Your orthodontist adjusts them every few weeks, and your teeth move accordingly.

**Removable options** are the clear aligners you've probably heard about, with Invisalign being the most well-known brand. These are custom-made plastic trays that fit over your teeth. You wear them for twenty-two hours a day, taking them out only to eat and brush your teeth. Every week or two, you switch to a new set that moves your teeth a little further.

Both approaches work. The right choice depends on what's going on with your teeth, how visible you want the treatment to be, and how much you're willing to spend.

## What Everything Actually Costs

Let's talk numbers, because this is probably what you're really wondering about.

For clear aligners, prices vary enormously depending on how much movement your teeth need. Simple cases with minor crowding can start around £1,500 to £2,000. Moderate cases typically run £2,500 to £3,500. Complex cases requiring significant movement can go up to £4,500 or beyond.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/), our [clear aligner packages](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) start at £2,999 for comprehensive treatment, which includes everything from your initial consultation through to retainers at the end.

Metal braces tend to range from £2,000 to £4,500 depending on complexity. Ceramic braces, because the brackets cost more to make, usually add a few hundred pounds on top of that, typically £2,500 to £5,000.

And then there are lingual braces, the ones fitted behind your teeth. These are the most expensive option, often £5,000 to £8,000 or more. The cost reflects how technically demanding they are to fit and adjust, and the fact that not all orthodontists offer them.

The variation in pricing comes down to a few things: how much your teeth need to move, how long treatment will take, where you're located (London practices generally charge more), and the experience level of whoever is treating you.

## How Long This Actually Takes

Here's where adults often get a pleasant surprise. Treatment times are usually shorter than you'd expect.

For clear aligners, most adults finish within twelve to eighteen months. Mild cases can be done in six months or even less. The more complex your case, the longer it takes, but two years would be on the longer end for most situations.

Traditional braces typically take eighteen to twenty-four months for adults, though simpler cases can be faster. The reason braces sometimes take longer than aligners is that they're often used for more complex corrections, the kind of movements that aligners might struggle with.

You'll start seeing changes within the first few months of treatment. That's one of the things people comment on most: how quickly they notice their teeth shifting. It's not instant, but it's visible progress, and that makes the whole process feel worthwhile.

## The Visibility Question

Let's be honest about what's often the biggest concern for adults: you don't want to walk into meetings or meet clients or go on dates looking like you've travelled back to secondary school.

Clear aligners are nearly invisible. When you're wearing them, most people won't notice unless they're really looking. They're smooth plastic, custom-fitted to your teeth, and while they're not literally invisible, they're close enough that you can go about your life without feeling self-conscious.

Ceramic braces are a middle ground. The brackets are tooth-coloured, so they blend in better than metal, though the wires can still be visible depending on which type is used. From a few feet away, they're much less noticeable than the traditional metal kind.

Lingual braces are genuinely invisible. Because they're fitted to the back of your teeth, no one can see them at all. The trade-off is they can take some getting used to, they're harder to clean, and they cost significantly more.

Metal braces are, well, visible. Some adults embrace this. Others prefer one of the more discreet options. There's no wrong answer; it depends on what matters to you.

## Why Adults Often Get Better Results

Here's something orthodontists notice: adults tend to be better patients than teenagers.

When you're paying for treatment yourself, when you've made an active decision to do this, you follow the instructions. You wear your aligners for the full twenty-two hours. You turn up to appointments. You don't lose your retainers.

Teenagers, bless them, are not known for their diligence. They forget to wear their aligners. They eat things they're not supposed to eat with braces on. They lose retainers. They miss appointments because something better came up.

The result is that adult treatment often goes more smoothly and more predictably than teenage treatment, even though adult teeth technically take a bit longer to move.

## When Straightening Won't Work Alone

Sometimes teeth straightening is part of a bigger picture.

If you've got missing teeth, crowns, or bridges, that affects what's possible. Orthodontic treatment moves natural teeth; it can't move dental work. An experienced dentist can often work around existing dental work, but it's something that needs to be planned for.

If you've got gum disease, that needs to be treated first. Moving teeth through unhealthy gums and bone isn't a good idea. The same goes for cavities or other dental problems: get those sorted, then think about straightening.

And for some people, particularly those with significant bite issues or jaw problems, straightening alone isn't enough. These cases might need a combination of orthodontic treatment and other work to get the best result.

This is exactly what the initial consultation is for. A good dentist will look at your whole mouth, understand what you're hoping to achieve, and tell you honestly what's realistic and what isn't.

## The Emotional Side of This

There's something that comes up again and again when adults talk about getting their teeth straightened.

It's not really about the teeth. Not exactly.

It's about that moment when you realise you've stopped noticing your teeth in photos. When you laugh without covering your mouth. When someone compliments your smile and you just... accept it, instead of deflecting.

Adults who straighten their teeth often describe feeling like they've finally dealt with something that's been bothering them for years. Sometimes decades. There's a relief to it that goes beyond aesthetics.

One thing people mention: they wish they'd done it sooner. Not in a regretful way, exactly. More like recognition that the thing they'd been putting off turned out to be far more manageable than they'd built it up to be.

## What Happens After Treatment

Once your teeth are straight, you need to keep them that way. Teeth have a tendency to drift back toward their original positions, especially in the first year or two after treatment.

That's where retainers come in. Most people wear a removable retainer at night, sometimes every night at first, then gradually less often as time goes on. Some people opt for a fixed retainer, a thin wire bonded to the back of their front teeth that keeps everything in place permanently.

At UrgentCare Dental, retainers are included in your treatment cost. Fixed retainers are £199 per set, and removable retainers are £250 per set.

The retainer stage is where a lot of people's previous orthodontic work comes undone. They had braces as a teenager, got their retainer, stopped wearing it, and watched their teeth slowly shuffle back to where they started. If you're going through this process as an adult, the retainer is non-negotiable. Wear it.

## Where to Start

The first step is always a consultation. Someone needs to look at your teeth, understand what you're hoping for, and work out what makes sense.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/), the consultation is free. You'll get a proper assessment, a clear explanation of your options, and an honest conversation about what's realistic for your particular situation.

If you've got a [smile makeover](/blog/smile-makeover-costs) in mind, where straightening is just one part of a bigger transformation, that's worth mentioning too. Sometimes the best approach combines straightening with [whitening](/blog/teeth-whitening-cost-uk) or [bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) or other work. Your dentist can help you think through the sequencing and what makes sense to do when.

And if you've been thinking about this for a while? If you've been meaning to look into it but never quite got around to it?

This is that moment. The one where you stop thinking about it and actually find out what's involved. It's less complicated than you think, it takes less time than you think, and the version of you on the other side of it is going to wonder why you waited so long.
