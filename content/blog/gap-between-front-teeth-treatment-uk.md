The gap between the two front teeth has a proper name: diastema. And it has a complicated relationship with the people who have it. Some love it. Madonna, Georgia May Jagger, Eddie Murphy: the gap became part of the look, part of the identity. For others, it's the thing they notice in every photograph, the reason they smile with their mouth closed, the feature they've been thinking about changing for years.

Both responses are entirely valid. A diastema is not a dental problem. It's a variation in dental anatomy, like having slightly crooked teeth or teeth that are bigger or smaller than average. It doesn't affect dental health, doesn't cause pain, and doesn't need treating unless the person who has it wants it treated.

And if they do want it treated? The options are more varied, more affordable, and more accessible than most people realise.

## What Causes the Gap

Understanding why the gap exists helps determine the best treatment approach.

**Jaw and tooth size mismatch.** If the jawbone is large relative to the teeth, or the teeth are small relative to the jaw, there's more space than the teeth need. The excess space shows up as gaps, most visibly between the upper front teeth.

**Missing lateral incisors.** Some people are congenitally missing one or both upper lateral incisors (the teeth next to the front two). The remaining teeth spread to partially fill the space, but a gap persists.

**Oversized labial frenum.** The frenum is the tissue that connects the upper lip to the gum between the front teeth. If this tissue is unusually thick or extends too far down between the teeth, it can prevent the teeth from closing together naturally.

**Tongue thrust.** A swallowing pattern where the tongue pushes forward against the front teeth can gradually push them apart, creating or widening a diastema. This is more common in children but can persist into adulthood.

**Gum disease.** [Advanced periodontitis](/blog/gum-disease-treatment-prices) weakens the bone supporting the front teeth, allowing them to drift apart. This is a late-stage gum disease presentation where the gap is a symptom of a bigger problem.

**Previous orthodontic relapse.** Teeth that were straightened with braces in youth can drift back toward their original positions if retainers aren't worn, reopening spaces that were closed.

## The Treatment Options

### Composite Bonding

[Composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) is the quickest, most affordable, and least invasive option. The dentist builds up the sides of the front teeth with tooth-coloured composite resin, widening each tooth to close the gap.

The procedure takes 30-60 minutes per tooth, done in a single appointment. No drilling is required: the composite is applied directly to the existing enamel surface. The dentist sculpts the material by hand, shaping each tooth to look natural in its new, wider form. A curing light hardens the composite, and final polishing gives it the surface texture and sheen of natural enamel.

The result is immediate. You walk in with a gap and walk out without one. The teeth look natural: the composite is colour-matched and shaped to blend seamlessly.

Cost: [£299 per tooth at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing). Two teeth: £598.

Longevity: [5-7 years](/blog/composite-bonding-lifespan) before the bonding needs refreshing. The composite can stain, chip, or wear over time, but repairs are quick and affordable.

**Best for:** small to moderate gaps (1-3mm), patients who want an immediate result, patients who prefer a reversible treatment (the bonding can be removed, returning the teeth to their original state).

### Porcelain Veneers

[Porcelain veneers](/blog/porcelain-veneers-cost-uk) cover the entire front surface of each tooth with a thin ceramic shell, closing the gap while also transforming the colour, shape, and alignment of the teeth.

The procedure requires two appointments. At the first, a thin layer of enamel is removed from the front of each tooth (0.3-0.5mm), and impressions are taken. At the second, the custom-made porcelain veneers are bonded to the prepared teeth.

The result is a comprehensive transformation: not just the gap closed, but the overall smile refined. The porcelain has a translucency and depth that mimics natural enamel beautifully.

Cost: [£695 per tooth at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing). Two teeth: £1,390. For patients who want a broader transformation (improving the colour and shape of 4-6 teeth alongside closing the gap), the total investment is £2,780-£4,170.

Longevity: 10-15 years for porcelain veneers.

**Best for:** moderate gaps combined with other cosmetic concerns (discolouration, minor chips, slight misalignment), patients who want a long-lasting result with minimal maintenance.

### Clear Aligners

[Clear aligners](/blog/clear-aligners-cost-uk) (like ClearCorrect or Invisalign) move the teeth themselves, physically closing the gap by repositioning the teeth in the jaw. This is the orthodontic approach: rather than adding material to the teeth, the teeth are moved to eliminate the space.

Treatment involves wearing a series of clear, removable plastic trays that gradually shift the teeth. Each tray is worn for 1-2 weeks before progressing to the next. The total treatment time for closing a simple diastema is typically 3-6 months, shorter than full orthodontic treatment for complex misalignment.

The result is natural teeth in a new position: no bonding, no veneers, no material added. The gap closes because the teeth have moved together.

Cost: [£2,999 at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing) for clear aligners. This includes the full treatment: scans, aligners, and retainers.

Longevity: permanent, provided retainers are worn. Without a retainer, the teeth can drift back toward their original positions.

**Best for:** patients who want to move the teeth rather than alter them, larger gaps (3mm+), gaps combined with other alignment issues (mild crowding, rotation), patients who want a permanent result.

### Dental Crowns

[Crowns](/blog/types-of-dental-crowns-uk) cover the entire visible tooth, widening it to close the gap. This is more aggressive than bonding or veneers: more enamel is removed, and the entire tooth is reshaped.

Crowns are rarely the first choice for closing a diastema unless the teeth also need crowning for other reasons (large existing fillings, previous [root canal treatment](/blog/root-canal-treatment-cost-uk), significant structural damage). If the teeth are healthy and the only concern is the gap, bonding, veneers, or aligners are preferable because they preserve more natural tooth structure.

Cost: [£650 per tooth at UrgentCare Dental](/pricing).

### Frenectomy

If an oversized frenum is contributing to the gap, a frenectomy (surgical removal of the excess tissue) prevents the frenum from holding the teeth apart. This is a minor surgical procedure: a few minutes under local anaesthetic, dissolvable stitches, and a 1-week recovery.

A frenectomy alone doesn't close an existing gap: it removes the force that's holding the gap open. The gap itself still needs closing with one of the above treatments. The frenectomy is done first (or simultaneously), allowing the subsequent treatment to be effective long-term.

Cost: £100-£400.

## The Comparison

| Method | Cost (2 teeth) | Treatment Time | Longevity | Reversible? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Composite bonding | £598 | 1 hour | 5-7 years | Yes |
| Porcelain veneers | £1,390 | 2 weeks | 10-15 years | No |
| Clear aligners | £2,999 | 3-6 months | Permanent | N/A |
| Crowns | £1,300 | 2 weeks | 10-20 years | No |

The right choice depends on the gap size, the overall cosmetic goals, the budget, and the patient's preference for treatment speed versus permanence.

## Small Gaps vs Large Gaps

**Gaps up to 2mm** are ideally suited to composite bonding. The amount of material added to each tooth is small, and the result looks natural. The teeth aren't widened enough to look disproportionate. This is the sweet spot for bonding: quick, affordable, and aesthetically excellent.

**Gaps of 2-4mm** can be addressed with bonding, veneers, or aligners. Bonding at this size requires more material, and the widened teeth may look slightly broader than natural. Veneers can compensate by adjusting the shape and proportions. Aligners close the gap by moving the teeth, avoiding the width issue entirely.

**Gaps of 4mm+** are generally best addressed with aligners. Adding enough material to close a large gap with bonding or veneers makes the teeth look disproportionately wide. Moving the teeth together preserves natural proportions.

**Gaps caused by gum disease** need [periodontal treatment](/blog/deep-cleaning-teeth-cost-uk) first. Closing a gap cosmetically while ignoring the underlying bone loss doesn't address the cause, and the teeth may continue to drift.

## The Smile Preview

Before committing to any treatment, seeing the expected result makes the decision concrete. At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the smile preview tool shows what the closed gap would look like before any treatment begins. For bonding and veneers, this preview shapes expectations and helps choose between options. For aligners, digital treatment planning shows the projected tooth movements step by step.

The preview turns "what would it look like?" from an abstract question into a visible answer. Some patients see the preview and decide to proceed immediately. Others see it and decide they actually prefer the gap. Both outcomes are valuable: the preview ensures the decision is informed.

## The Consultation

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the diastema consultation covers the assessment (why the gap exists, whether it's stable or widening), the options ([composite bonding at £299 per tooth](/pricing), [porcelain veneers at £695 per tooth](/pricing), [clear aligners at £2,999](/pricing)), and the expected result.

The gap between front teeth is a feature, not a flaw. Closing it is a choice, not a necessity. And for those who make that choice, the options are accessible, the results are excellent, and the transformation is, quite literally, smile-changing.
