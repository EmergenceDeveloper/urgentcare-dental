The extraction itself took less than an hour. You barely felt it. If you had [IV sedation](/blog/what-iv-sedation-feels-like), you don't remember it at all. And now you're sitting at home with a mouth full of gauze, a numb face, and a very specific question: what happens next?

The recovery from [wisdom teeth removal](/blog/emergency-wisdom-tooth-removal-uk) follows a remarkably predictable pattern. Nearly everyone goes through the same sequence of swelling, soreness, and gradual improvement over about a week. Knowing what each day looks like in advance takes the anxiety out of every new sensation, because instead of thinking "is this normal?" you're thinking "ah yes, this is the day-two swelling they mentioned."

So here's the whole thing. Day by day.

## Day One: The Numb Phase

The local anaesthetic wears off somewhere between two and four hours after the procedure. While it's still working, your face feels like it belongs to someone else. Talking is strange. Drinking is an exercise in concentration, because your lip doesn't quite know where the cup is. Your tongue keeps exploring the extraction site and finding it fascinating.

This is the window to get painkillers on board. Take ibuprofen and paracetamol before the numbness fully wears off, so the medication is working by the time sensation returns. These two work on different pathways and can be taken together safely, alternating every few hours for continuous coverage.

When the numbness fades, there's soreness. It's real and it's there, but if the painkillers are already in your system, it's a manageable background ache rather than the sharp jolt you might be expecting. The socket itself might throb a bit, that rhythmic pulse of blood flow to a healing site.

There'll be some blood. It mixes with saliva and looks like much more than it actually is. The gauze pad placed over the socket absorbs the worst of it. Changing the gauze every 30-45 minutes for the first few hours is normal. By the evening, the bleeding typically reduces to a slight ooze.

Eating on day one is soft and simple. Yoghurt, soup (not too hot), mashed potato, scrambled eggs, smoothies. Anything that doesn't require chewing. The other side of your mouth is technically fine, but your whole jaw feels a bit fragile and most people default to the softest things they can find.

The blood clot forming in the socket is the single most important thing happening right now. That clot is the foundation of healing. It's a biological scaffold that protects the exposed bone and provides the framework for new tissue to grow. Protecting it means no vigorous rinsing, no using straws (the suction can dislodge it), no poking at it with your tongue (hard to resist, but worth the effort), and no smoking.

## Day Two: The Peak

This is usually the hardest day, and knowing that in advance genuinely helps.

Swelling reaches its maximum around 48 hours after surgery. If one wisdom tooth was removed, the swelling is localised to that side. If all four came out at once, both cheeks puff up and you look like you're storing acorns. It's a good look for a hamster. Less so for a human. But it's temporary and it's completely normal.

Your jaw feels stiff. Opening wide is uncomfortable and possibly limited. The muscles around the extraction site are inflamed and they're letting you know about it. Jaw exercises aren't necessary at this point; just let it rest.

Some people see bruising appear on day two. It tends to show up on the jaw and cheek, sometimes tracking down to the neck. The bruising looks alarming but is simply blood from the surgical site tracking through the tissue. It's cosmetic, harmless, and fades over the following week.

Pain on day two is usually the most intense, but "most intense" is relative. With ibuprofen and paracetamol maintaining coverage, most people describe it as a dull, persistent ache rather than sharp pain. If the dentist prescribed something stronger (codeine-based painkillers are common for surgical extractions), day two is when that prescription earns its keep.

Food remains soft. The temptation to try something more substantial is real, but the extraction site is still raw and anything that requires proper chewing risks disturbing the healing clot or getting food packed into the socket.

## Day Three: Holding Steady

Day three is often similar to day two. The swelling might still be at or near its peak. The soreness continues. You're tired of soft food and slightly bored of being uncomfortable.

This is when gentle salt water rinses can begin (if your dentist gave the go-ahead). A teaspoon of salt in warm water, gently swished around the mouth and allowed to fall out rather than spat forcefully. The salt water keeps the area clean and creates an environment that's unfriendly to bacteria. It also feels genuinely soothing on inflamed tissue.

If you had stitches (dissolvable ones are most common for wisdom teeth), they're still intact and doing their job. Some people can feel them with their tongue, which is a strange new texture to get used to.

Day three is a patience day. Nothing dramatic happens. The body is working. You're waiting.

## Day Four: The Corner

Something shifts on day four for most people, and it's noticeable.

The swelling starts to recede. The jaw feels slightly less stiff. The background ache drops a degree. You might not need the stronger painkillers anymore, with ibuprofen and paracetamol doing the job on their own.

Eating starts to feel more normal. Not full meals with steak and crusty bread, but softer foods that require some gentle chewing: pasta, fish, well-cooked vegetables, soft sandwiches. The other side of the mouth (if only one side was operated on) is probably fine for normal eating by now.

This is the day when people who had their wisdom teeth out on a Friday start thinking about going back to work on Monday. The worst is past, the trajectory is clearly improving, and the gap between "recovery" and "normal life" is visibly closing.

## Days Five to Seven: The Return

By day five, most people feel significantly better. The swelling is noticeably down. The soreness has faded to a minor awareness that something happened in your mouth, but it's no longer dominating your day. Painkillers become optional for many people at this point.

The socket is covered with a layer of soft tissue. It's not fully healed; there's still a depression where the tooth was. But the raw, exposed feeling of the first few days has been replaced by something more settled. Your tongue can explore the area without sensitivity.

Normal eating returns for most people by day five to seven. The only exception is very hard or crunchy foods (nuts, hard sweets, crusty bread) which can irritate the healing socket. Favouring the other side of the mouth for those items is instinctive and sensible.

If dissolvable stitches were used, they typically start dissolving around day seven to ten. Little pieces come away while eating or rinsing, which is slightly odd but completely normal.

## Week Two and Beyond

The surface healing continues rapidly. By two weeks, the gum tissue over the extraction site has closed significantly. There's still a dip or indentation where the tooth was, but it's covered with new gum tissue and no longer sensitive.

Underneath the surface, the bone is healing too, but this takes longer. Full bone regeneration in the socket takes 6-8 weeks. You won't feel this happening; it's entirely internal. But it's why the slight depression in the gum gradually fills in over the following months until, eventually, the area is smooth and flat.

By three to four weeks, most people have completely forgotten about the extraction in their daily lives. The area feels normal. Eating is unrestricted. The only reminder is running your tongue along the back of your mouth and noticing the extra space where a wisdom tooth used to crowd things.

## The Thing That Keeps People Up at Night: Dry Socket

Dry socket is the complication that everyone hears about and nobody wants. It deserves honest coverage because the fear of it is often worse than the reality.

A dry socket (alveolar osteitis) happens when the blood clot in the extraction site is dislodged or doesn't form properly, leaving the underlying bone exposed. It causes intense, radiating pain that typically starts 3-5 days after the extraction, right when you'd expect things to be getting better.

The incidence is relatively low: about 2-5% of standard extractions and up to 25-30% of impacted lower wisdom tooth extractions. Smoking is the single biggest risk factor, increasing the chance dramatically. Using straws, vigorous rinsing, and spitting forcefully in the first few days are other risk factors.

If dry socket happens, the treatment is straightforward. The dentist places a medicated dressing directly into the socket, which provides almost immediate pain relief. The dressing is changed every few days until the socket starts healing. It extends the recovery timeline by about a week, and it's genuinely unpleasant while it lasts, but it resolves completely.

The key data point: the vast majority of people (70-98% depending on the type of extraction) recover without dry socket. It's worth knowing about, but statistically, it's the exception rather than the rule.

## What the Recovery Costs

The recovery itself costs very little beyond what you'll spend at the supermarket on soft food.

Over-the-counter painkillers (ibuprofen and paracetamol) run a few pounds. If a prescription painkiller is provided, that's £9.90 for a standard prescription charge.

If antibiotics were prescribed alongside the extraction (common for infected wisdom teeth), that's another £9.90.

Ice packs for the swelling are useful but not essential. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works identically.

The main cost, if there is one, is time off work. Most people take 1-3 days off for wisdom teeth recovery, depending on the complexity of the extraction and how their recovery progresses. Day four or five is the typical return point for office-based work. Physical or manual work might need another day or two.

The extraction itself at [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us) costs [£549 per wisdom tooth](/pricing), with a combined [extraction and sedation package at £695](/pricing) for patients who prefer [IV sedation](/blog/sedation-for-tooth-extraction-uk).

## The Bit That Makes It All Worth It

There's a moment, usually around week two, when something clicks.

That crowded, tight feeling at the back of your mouth? Gone. That flap of gum that kept getting food stuck under it? Gone. That dull ache that would flare up every few months? Gone.

The recovery is a week of inconvenience for a lifetime of relief. The wisdom tooth that was causing problems will never cause problems again, because it's sitting in a surgical tray somewhere, smaller than you imagined, and your mouth has already started forgetting it was ever there.

At [UrgentCare Dental](/about-us), the post-extraction check-up makes sure everything's healing as expected. By the time that appointment comes around, most people are already feeling the quiet satisfaction of having dealt with something they'd been putting off. The recovery wasn't fun, but it was predictable, manageable, and completely worth it.

Your jaw heals. Your mouth settles. And the wisdom tooth becomes a story you tell people: "it was honestly fine, I just ate a lot of soup."
