Wakefield doesn't always get the attention it deserves.

Tucked between Leeds and the countryside, it has that rare quality of feeling like a proper city while still being manageable. The cathedral. The Hepworth. The waterfront that's come into its own over the past decade. It's a place with genuine character, not just a suburb pretending to be something else.

We're writing this because we realise we've never properly said hello.

UrgentCare Dental is based in Leeds, at Whitehall Estate in Armley. For anyone in Wakefield, that's about twenty minutes in the car, straight up the M1 or along the A61 if you prefer the scenic route. Close enough to be convenient, far enough that we're probably not on your radar unless you've specifically gone looking.

So consider this an introduction.

## What We Do

We're an emergency and urgent care dental practice, which means we're set up for the moments when something's gone wrong and you need to be seen quickly. A tooth that's been aching for days. Something that cracked over the weekend. Pain that's stopped you sleeping.

Our [emergency appointments](/pricing) are £20, and we're open seven days a week. If you need to be seen today, you usually can be.

But we're not only emergencies. We do the full range of general and [cosmetic dentistry](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) too. Check-ups, fillings, crowns, [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), [whitening](/pricing), [implants](/implants). The works. Dr. Zain Chishty is our Clinical Director, and he's built a team here that genuinely cares about making dental care accessible and affordable.

## Why We're Reaching Out

Honestly? Because we know finding a dentist can feel like a bit of a mission these days.

We're not going to get into the politics of it. We just know that a lot of people in Wakefield, and across West Yorkshire generally, have been left in a situation where they're not quite sure where to turn when they need dental care. Some have been putting things off for years.

If that's you, the door's open. No judgement about how long it's been. No lectures. Just good dental care at transparent prices, with a team that's happy to see you.

## Come Say Hello

If you're curious, you can see everything we offer on our [pricing page](/pricing). No hidden fees, no surprises. What's listed is what you pay.

Or if you'd rather just have a chat first, [get in touch](/contact). We're real people, and we're happy to answer questions before you commit to anything.

Wakefield's a great place. We're glad to be nearby.

And if you ever need us, we're just down the road.
