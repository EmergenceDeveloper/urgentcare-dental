Bradford has a presence that's hard to miss.

It's a city that's been through a lot and wears its history openly. The wool exchange, the Alhambra, Cartwright Hall up in Lister Park. Little Germany with its merchant buildings still standing. There's a weight to the place, a sense that things have happened here and will keep happening.

It's also right next door to us.

UrgentCare Dental is in Leeds, at Whitehall Estate in Armley. From most of Bradford, that's fifteen to twenty minutes. From the city centre, you're looking at a straight shot down the A647. We see patients from Bradford regularly, and we wanted to make this a bit more official.

Hello, Bradford. We're glad you're nearby.

## What We Offer

We're built around emergency and urgent dental care. When something goes wrong, you shouldn't have to wait days to be seen. Our [emergency appointments](/pricing) are £20, and we're open every day, including weekends.

But that's not all we do. We've grown into a full-service practice offering everything from [routine check-ups](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk) to [cosmetic treatments](/blog/smile-makeover-costs) like [composite bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing) and [teeth whitening](/pricing). We do [implants](/implants), [crowns](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk), [bridges](/blog/dental-bridge-cost-uk), [dentures](/blog/dentures-cost-uk). If it's dental, we probably do it.

Dr. Zain Chishty is our Clinical Director, and he's made affordability a core part of how we operate. The [prices on our website](/pricing) are real. No hidden consultations fees, no surprise costs at the end.

## You're Welcome Here

Bradford's a big city with a lot of people, and we know dental care hasn't always been easy to access.

We're not here to fill a gap or make a political point. We're just a dental practice that does good work at fair prices, and we happen to be very close by.

If you need us, we're here. And if you're not sure what you need, [get in touch](/contact) and we'll help you figure it out.
