Bingley sits in one of those valleys that makes you understand why people settled in Yorkshire in the first place.

The Aire running through. The Five Rise Locks stepping up the hillside like something from another century, because they are. The moors visible from town on a clear day. It's the kind of place where you can be in proper countryside within ten minutes of your front door, but still catch a train into Leeds or Bradford when you need to.

We're UrgentCare Dental, based over in Leeds at Whitehall Estate in Armley. That's about twenty-five minutes from Bingley by car, or you can come through Shipley if you prefer. Not exactly next door, but close enough that we wanted to say hello.

## What We're About

We started as an emergency dental practice. The kind of place people come when they're in pain and need to be seen fast. That's still at the heart of what we do. [Emergency appointments](/pricing) are £20, we're open seven days a week, and if you call in the morning you can usually be seen the same day.

Over time, we've grown into a full general and cosmetic practice too. [Check-ups](/blog/dental-checkup-costs-uk), [fillings](/blog/white-filling-costs-uk), [crowns](/blog/dental-crown-cost-uk), [bonding](/blog/composite-bonding-cost-uk-pricing), [implants](/implants), the lot. Our Clinical Director, Dr. Zain Chishty, has built a team that cares about doing good work at honest prices.

## If You've Been Putting It Off

A lot of people have.

Life gets busy. The months turn into years. And then at some point you realise it's been a while and you're not quite sure where to start.

Start here, if you like. We're not going to make it weird. We're just going to take care of whatever needs taking care of, explain your options clearly, and let you decide what's right for you. Our [pricing](/pricing) is all online, no surprises.

Bingley's a lovely spot. If you ever need dental care and don't mind a short drive, we'd be glad to see you.
